## Lists

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
3. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
4. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

- Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
- Or pluses

1. Make my changes

   1. Fix bug
   2. Improve formatting

2. Push my commits to GitHub
3. Open a pull request

---

- Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
- Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:

  - Marker character change forces new list start:

    - Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    - Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit

- Very easy!

## Ignoring Markdown formatting

You can tell GitHub to ignore (or escape) Markdown formatting by using \ before the Markdown character.

Let's rename \*our-new-project\* to \*our-old-project\*.

## Links

[I'm an inline-style link](https://google.com)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link](https://www.mozilla.org)

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions](https://slashdot.org)

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself](https://www.reddit.com).

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links.
https://www.example.com or <https://www.example.com> and sometimes
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

## Blockquotes

> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.
>
> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can _put_ **Markdown** into a blockquote.
>
> Blockquotes can also be nested...
>
> > ...by using additional greater-than signs right next to each other...
> >
> > > ...or with spaces between arrows.
