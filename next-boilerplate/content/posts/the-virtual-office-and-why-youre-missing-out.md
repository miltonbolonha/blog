Office rent prices are always rising with each passing year. It is becoming increasingly hard for businesses to hire good talent while at the same time keep their overhead costs low. This is perhaps one of the major reasons why virtual offices have become mainstream over the last decade. Telecommuting, as it is also known is a great way of making sure that employees do the required work without having to worry about added costs such as rent and office furniture and supplies. In this post, we’ll take a look at some of the advantages of having a virtual office compared to a brick-and-mortar one.

## Saves Time

Virtual offices can save a lot of time, freeing up this resource so it can be used towards more productive endeavors. People all around the world wake up on a daily basis to get ready to [head to work](https://blog.personalcapital.com/financial-planning-2/surprising-costs-commute/). They then head out the door, only to spend anywhere between half an hour to an hour in traffic. The same applies for the commute back in the evening. This usually means that the average worker may spend up to 3 hours every day getting ready and going to work and then coming back home. Individuals who have virtual offices don’t have to worry about any of this, making it more likely for them to be more productive.

## Ideal for Certain Personalities

Virtual offices are also ideal for certain personalities who would rather work alone. This is especially true of introverts and creatives as well as type ‘A’ personalities who may need the feeling of being in control in order to work in an efficient manner. At the same time, certain careers are better suited to a virtual workplace such as people who are in the media and writing industry, scientists, people in finance and those in management.

## Hiring Great Talent is Easy

Given the fact that virtual offices don’t require individuals to be in one location, you as the business owner are free to hire people from other parts of the country and [internationally](http://hiring.monster.com/hr/hr-best-practices/monster-training/security-center/hiring-non-us-workers.aspx). This puts you in touch with exceptional talent for a much cheaper price, which in the end boosts your bottom line.

## Good for the Environment

Virtual offices have also been shown to be good for the environment. Given the little to no need for commuting or purchasing office supplies and other items that may be needed for a physical office, companies that are choosing to go virtual are helping preserve the environment by reducing their carbon footprints to negligible levels.

## Flexibility

Virtual offices also provide your employees with flexibility that may actually boost productivity. It has been shown that when people feel comfortable, they are more likely to be more motivated and give their best. The truth is that most employees do not need to be watched like hawks in order for them to be productive.

With a virtual office, you are also able to run multiple businesses as well as 24 hour businesses should you decide to hire people from all over the world. This means a bigger bottom line for you and faster growth in the end, taking your operation to new heights.
