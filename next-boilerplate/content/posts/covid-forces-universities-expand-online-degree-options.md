COVID has impacted every aspect of our lives. For those trying to complete their education, it has become even harder. Many of the most prestigious colleges and universities have seen significant drops in enrollment numbers. In an attempt to continue to provide students with the best possible education, many have started to offer online degree programs for students who are interested in enrolling. The benefits of this type of learning are extensive and are opening many doors for students who may not have considered attending the school otherwise.

**Added Convenience**

Online degree programs offer a level of convenience that on-campus classes don’t. There is no commute to and from class. Students can attend from almost anywhere and if they are already employed, can continue to work their regular schedule. Online courses also provide additional resources students can refer back to if they have questions or are looking for suggestions on how to complete an assignment. The online learning platform makes it easy for them to communicate with faculty members or find out when assignments are due.

**Less Anxiety**

For many students, attending a classroom can lead to higher than normal anxiety levels. Constant distractions can make it difficult for them to focus on their studies. Being able to attend the school of their choice using an online learning platform makes it easier for them to retain the information they are learning. They can focus on their assignments with limited distractions and commit themselves fully to their studies. Students who are known to have anxiety can often stay motivated much easier when using an online format because they feel at ease.

**Valuable Resources**

As more and more of the highly recognized universities and colleges begin to offer online degree programs, they are also providing more online resources as well. This allows students to have many of the same advantages as the students who are enrolled in classroom degree programs. While they may not be able to attend the school’s library, much of the learning material they will need can be found online or by accessing the student portal. These valuable resources allow them to share the same overall learning experience, only at a distance.

**Safer for At-Risk Students**

Even with social distancing and the use of masks and other PPE, there are several students who are considered to be at a higher risk than others. Students who have chronic illnesses or are taking certain types of medication must be very careful about where they go and who they meet. Being able to attend the school of their choice, especially if it is one of the more prestigious ones, is a dream come true for many. Many of the online degree programs are held in conjunction with traditional classroom sessions so students can feel as if they are in the classroom even though they are safe at home. Students who are at risk are finding it much easier to attend school now that COVID has forced the issue of online learning programs.

**Accredited Degree Programs**

Prestigious colleges and universities are offering online degree programs that are accredited both regionally and in specialty areas. This ensures students will get the best possible education from schools and programs that exceed industry standards. It also means that the course has been thoroughly evaluated to ensure that each student is getting the most advanced and up-to-date information possible. They will have everything they need to graduate and feel confident they can accomplish any goal. Accreditation on both the specialty and regional level is an ongoing achievement that many schools of higher learning are committed to. It shows their willingness to ensure the success of their students.

**Begin Your Search For An Online Degree Now**

Due to COVID-19, many of the most highly-respected universities and colleges in the country are opening their doors, or online portals, to students who want to attend their degree programs. They receive the same quality education and resources as on-campus students and are able to utilize every asset and resource the school has to offer. Students can choose the school of their dreams that they may not have otherwise been able to attend. The COVID pandemic has changed many things about how colleges and universities are handling their online degree programs. Opening their enrollment to online students is making it possible for more and more students to enroll in the most prestigious schools in the country.
