Our energy consumption as a nation keeps growing almost exponentially, necessitating a hunger for energy the likes of which has never seen before in our modern times. At the same time, greenhouse gases caused by burning fossil fuel as well as setting up nuclear power plants has led to the worsening of global warming, which has in turn caused erratic weather patterns and unpredictable events all over the world. It thus makes sense to find ways which we can all chip in and reduce the amount of energy we consume on a daily basis. In this post, we’ll take a look at a few simple and practical ways that will help you cut down on your energy use as well as save you money in the long run.

## Energy Vampirism is a Major Culprit

Plasma and LED screens, gaming devices, DVD players, laptops and stereo systems have been shown to use up power even when they are off. This is because a lot of these electronic devices have inbuilt aspects such as a timer that need electricity to keep functioning. Before leaving the house or the living room, consider turning off the power switch at the socket to make sure everything is off. At the same time, don’t leave your computer hibernating because it still uses up electricity even when it’s on stand-by.

## Install Ceiling Fans

At any given time, we usually have the AC or heater on to either cool or warm up the house. However, these devices are usually flawed because they don’t cool nor heat your average room in a uniform manner. [Installing ceiling fans](https://www.bobvila.com/articles/2479-how-to-install-a-ceiling-fan/) can help air circulate better which means that cooling devices and heaters don’t have to work so hard while doing their job. A great tip here would be to install a fan that goes either way since hot days require anticlockwise fan movement and cold days, the opposite.

## Use Mother Nature to Dry Clothes

Dryer use happens without a second thought. That said, it’s not known by a lot of people that dryers use up a lot of electricity. A great way of getting rid of the dryer and saving money is to put up laundry lines outside and using both the wind and sun to dry your clothes. This is convenient and won’t cost you a dime, helping you save hundreds of dollars in your electric bill over a period of a year.

## Oven Use

We’ve all at one time or the other gotten into the habit of opening the oven door to check if whatever we’re cooking is done. What we don’t know is that doing this brings in cold air from the outside and into the oven itself, making the oven work much harder to make sure that the ambient temperature is kept at a certain level. Resist the urge to do so, and opt to peek through the glass window instead. In addition, you may want to use [a toaster oven](https://www.homeminders.com/Articles/HomemindersArticle/tabid/77/ArticleId/520/Default.aspx) if you’re making a smaller meal since it has lower energy consumption.

At the end of the day, getting creative as well as using these tips can help you save on your electric bill without having to employ extraordinary measures around the home.
