## Does a Degree Increase Your Income?

Thanks to the web, it is now possible for anyone to gain additional knowledge on nearly any subject. While online undergraduate degrees are still fairly expensive, they are far more affordable when there is no requirement to pay for accommodation, etc.

The first question to ask is whether taking any degree will really improve your salary once you graduate. Keeping in mind the huge amount of debt that most people will take on in order to study a bachelor’s degree, is it still going to be profitable over time?

The answer is that a bachelor’s degree will usually be profitable, but that this is never guaranteed. The salary you’ll enjoy once you finish an online course is going to be determined by a number of different factors, including the nature of the degree you completed, the amount of additional training and work you were willing to do, and even a healthy dose of luck!

Where all else is equal, most employers will prefer a candidate who has some sort of bachelor’s degree. This demonstrates a certain level of commitment, an analytic and critical mind, and the ability to work toward deadlines in a self-motivated manner. This is even truer of someone who had the self-determination to take an online degree with no-one looking over their shoulder to ensure that they completed everything on time.

Likewise, many companies will consider those holding bachelor’s degrees for managerial positions where they might not have otherwise.

Where the degree is relevant to the subject matter, this can open up potential job opportunities that simply wouldn’t have been on the table before. And likewise, that could mean a promotion within your current organization.

Likewise, you also shouldn’t underestimate the value of real-world experience, and of _actually_ spending time working in the environment that you are interested in.

## Is Taking an Online Bachelor’s Degree a Good Idea?

As long as you can spare the time and the investment, taking an online bachelor’s degree is a highly worthwhile option.
