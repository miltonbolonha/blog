## Why It Makes Financial and Practical Sense to Buy a New SUV in 2020

When it comes to saving money on cars, you probably don’t think of buying new! Buying second hand can greatly reduce the up-front cost of any vehicle, which in turn can make for a tantalizing option.

But here are some things to keep in mind about buying used:

- You’ll need to replace it sooner
- It won’t retain any value if you try to sell it back or trade it in (a few hundred dollars at best)
- It will be far more likely to experience problems that are expensive to repair
- Parts will be more expensive to source
- Tax will be more expensive

And the list goes on!

Conversely, when you buy a new car, you’ll be able to benefit from a range of great financing options, you’ll pay less tax, and it should last you for years and years. When you eventually do trade it in or sell it off, it will still have retained some of its value!

As you’ll see with this list, it’s actually possible to find very affordable SUVs these days, which make buying new a much better deal.

As such, it’s more than possible to enjoy a comfortable ride with that wonderful “new smell,” without spending the Earth.

## Why Choose a SUV

So, that’s why you should go new. But why a SUV?

For one, a SUV is a fantastic option for families. These cars give you plenty of space to pack in a bunch of kids and all their luggage! Better yet, is that they also protect you and your family thanks to their larger size. They’re highly versatile too: in many cases including fold-down seats and other options. Whether you’re moving home, or going on holiday, these features can be life-savers in a pinch.

Of course, many families in particular enjoy the fact that they can take their SUVs off-road for a spot of camping. But even if you don’t plan on off-roading, you’ll find that the four-wheel drive is still a wonderful feature to have when it comes to maneuverability and comfort.

Then there’s the fuel efficiency. SUVs offer fantastic fuel efficiency which makes them excellent for saving money, or for just being a little eco-friendlier.

## The Best, Most Affordable SUVs for 2020

So, you’re convinced and you’re looking for an affordable new SUV for 2020… where to start?

Here are just some of the most compelling deals available right now:

**Kia Soul**

The Kia Soul will only set you back around $17.5k – that’s before you start haggling! For that amount, you’re getting an awful lot of car<sup>1</sup>. This is a subcompact SUV, but it’s still giving you plenty of storage

2020 sees a complete redesign for this model, bringing a new engine at the entry level, with 17 more horsepower (for a total of 147) and a bumped-up fuel economy too. You’ll also find some plush new accessories and features here, such as the 7” touchscreen monitor. The only possible downside is that the interior uses some slightly cheaper materials. Still, the seats are comfortable and there is plenty of leg room – which is really the main selling point!

**Mazda CX-3**

The 2020 model is in many ways the same car as the 2019 model, and is a great deal in its own right<sup>2</sup>. The Mazda CX-3 is very affordable, offers a sporty drive, and has a great cabin that is comfortable and fun to drive in.

There are lots of features here, such as blind spot monitoring, and the 2L engine is capable of a lot of oomph with 148 horsepower.

The red is a particularly great look for this handsome vehicle, and it certainly feels like it should cost more than it does. Still, at $20,640, this is still one of the more expensive options on this list.

The 2020 Mazda CX-3 topped many best SUV lists last year and it’s easy to see why<sup>2</sup>.

**Nissan Kicks**

For prices around $18,870<sup>3</sup>, the Nissan Kicks is a brilliant option. You’ll get a whole lot of trunk space and a lot of features as-standard. For the 2020 model, Nissan brought some great new safety upgrades, which should be a priority for any family. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the car 4 stars in its rollover test. The other safety features include a lane departure warning, rear sensors, blind spot monitoring, and even pedestrian detection!

It’s not just about safety though. The car also offers great fuel efficiency (31/36 mpg) and a pretty nice design. You can even get a two-tone color scheme which will help this vehicle to stand out from the crowd (and make it easier to find when parked!).

The downside is the relatively smaller engine size at 122 horsepower. Acceleration is a little slow, and the brakes are a slightly soft – which is a shame in an otherwise highly safety-conscious vehicle.

**2020 Ford EcoSport**

The EcoSport has been a very popular vehicle for a while now, as a crossover SUV that is perfect for city-driving, especially for families<sup>4</sup>. The car does have its drawbacks: including a slightly sluggish power-train and relatively low comfort.

But with that said, it’s also a very strong choice for anyone looking for a reliable, eco-friendly car that won’t cost the Earth. Unfortunately, it’s also one of the more expensive options on this list owing to that aforementioned success at $20,000+.

**Honorable Mentions**

- Hyundai Kona
- Honda HR-V
- Toyota C-HR

## Closing Comments

As you can see, there are a surprising number of great SUVs available at very low prices. Any of these will offer you a lot of comfort, safety, and versatility as a daily run-around. You’ll find they are perfect for long trips or quick runs to the grocers, and you’ll get to enjoy the new-car smell along the way!

With prices starting at $17-18,000, and lots of financing options to be found, this might just prove to be a smart decision for you and your family.
