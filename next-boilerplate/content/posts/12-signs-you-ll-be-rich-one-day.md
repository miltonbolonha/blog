### Being Attractive Helps

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3991" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_3991" style="width: 700px">

How to be rich one day? Being perceived as attractive does seem to help push you towards becoming wealthy. It actually helps men more so than women. According to the American Economic Review, men who are seen as attractive make nine percent more than unattractive men. This number is much lower for women, as attractive women earn four percent more than unattractive women.

### The Popular Kids

Individuals who were popular in high school typically make 10 percent more than people who weren’t. There are many reasons behind why this might be the case. First, often the popular kids have wealthier families, which means they are able to afford higher-end educations. This can help land a better job and push them higher up the ladder. On the other hand, some people are popular simply because they are great with other people and make friends easily. Both can help individuals make more money and potentially become rich one day.

### College Matters

Some people might say where you go to college doesn’t matter, but in reality, it does. For example, someone who graduates from Dartmouth College is going to earn 162 percent more than someone who went to East Texas Baptist University. A higher-tier college comes with stature, and it is likely to help someone land a better job off of the name recognition alone. This just points to why going to a better college can in fact help you strike it rich one day. There is a reason many individuals who hold top jobs hold degrees from top universities and colleges.

### Strive to Be Tall

![4 Strive to Be Tall rich](/posts/4-Strive-to-Be-Tall-rich.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3994">[Franck_Boston](http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-44593291/stock-photo-young-couple-back-to-back-trying-to-talk-isolated-on-white.html)</figcaption></figure>

This one can be rolled up with the [looks category](http://www.businessinsider.com/15-signs-you-will-be-rich-2010-10?op=1). Taller people are more likely to make more money than shorter people. According to The Economic Record, women will earn anywhere from five to eight percent more for every three inches taller they are. For men, this number ranges from four to 10 percent more for every three inches. It is interesting, with so many beauty standards placed on women, men are the ones who are seemingly penalized more for their looks. An attractive man who is six inches taller than someone who is perceived as less attractive may make 29 percent more.

### Stay Married

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3995" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_3995" style="width: 700px">

![5 Stay Married rich](/posts/5-Stay-Married-rich.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3995">[gpointstudio](http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-287991707/stock-photo-happy-senior-couple-on-te-sofa.html)</figcaption></figure>

Being married and staying married can drastically help boost your net worth. In fact, someone who is married and stays married will increase their worth by 77 percent. Someone who stays married increases their average wealth by 16 percent every single year. While this doesn’t mean you should go out and try to get hitched right now, it does show the power and perception of marriage on others around you.

### Cheers

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3996" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_3996" style="width: 700px">

![6 Cheers rich](/posts/6-Cheers-rich.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3996">[Monkey_Business_Images](http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-238694314/stock-photo-group-of-friends-enjoying-evening-drinks-in-bar.html)</figcaption></figure>

While there is nothing wrong with turning down another round, someone who drinks is going to earn 10 to 14 percent more than those who don’t. This is because of the social aspect that comes with drinking. It helps bring together, not to mention deals and business agreements are often formed over drinks. So while you don’t need to be a heavy drinker, having a glass or two can help you ultimately become rich.

### Degree Matters

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3997" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_3997" style="width: 700px">

![7 Degree Matters rich](/posts/7-Degree-Matters-rich.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3997">[Tom_Wang](http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-177569810/stock-photo-businessman-cooperate-with-different-industries-people.html)</figcaption></figure>

This probably comes as no surprise, but the kind of degree you have matters. Someone who has a Bachelor’s degree in engineering is going to earn substantially more than someone in family studies. If you have a passion for something you shouldn’t fight it, as you may end up unhappy in the end, but some career paths are simply going to lead to more money than others.

### Drop the BMI

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3998" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_3998" style="width: 700px">

![8 Drop the BMI rich](/posts/8-Drop-the-BMI-rich.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3998">[designer491](http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-283177196/stock-photo-bmi-body-mass-index-formula-rate-formula-in-a-notepad.html)</figcaption></figure>

A person’s body mass index takes into account several different variables to determine their desirable weight. For every unit someone increases over their desired BMI, they see a drop off in income by eight percent. This is an average overall, yet it affects the sexes differently. While height and beauty affects men more, BMI drastically affects women more. Women see a 12 percent drop in wealth per point, while white men see a drop in only two percent.

### Have a Russian Ancestor

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3999" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_3999" style="width: 700px">

![9 Have a Russian Ancestor rich](/posts/9-Have-a-Russian-Ancestor-rich-e1470687289980.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3999">[gusenych](http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-423993283/stock-vector-icon-made-in-russia-on-the-flag-of-russia.html)

</figcaption></figure>

This is something you can’t really make up. You either have someone or you don’t. If you do, it is a really good sign you’ll likely make it rich. Why? Because 22 percent of households in the United States with a Russian ancestor has a net worth of over $1 million. That is by far higher than any other background.

### Invest in Real Estate Young

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4000" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_4000" style="width: 700px">

![10 Invest in Real Estate Young rich](/posts/10-Invest-in-Real-Estate-Young-rich.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-4000">[goodluz](http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-103885106/stock-photo-couple-in-real-estate-agency-talking-to-construction-planner.html)</figcaption></figure>

Invest in real estate when you’re young. Real estate is one of the best ways to make money as it is more recession proof than most other forms of investments and it will continually bring money in. The younger you invest in real estate the better the sign of you eventually striking it rich.

### Go Blonde

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4001" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_4001" style="width: 700px">

![11 Go Blonde rich](/posts/11-Go-Blonde-rich.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-4001">[loftflow](http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-363900452/stock-photo-cropped-shot-view-of-young-female-student-learning-on-line-on-her-laptop-computer-lovely-young.html)</figcaption></figure>

This is specifically for women, but blonde women make about seven percent more than non blond women. Also, in a rather interesting twist, men who marry blonde women actually make six percent more than men who don’t marry blonde women. So, having a blonde wife actually increases a couple’s net worth by 13 percent.

### Ditch the Cigs

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4002" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_4002" style="width: 700px">

![12 Ditch the Cigs rich](/posts/12-Ditch-the-Cigs-rich.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-4002">[ChameleonsEye](http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-110076689/stock-photo-concept-photo-of-a-man-quitting-smoking-by-breaking-a-cigarette.html)</figcaption></figure>

If you currently smoke, it might be time to quit. Non-smokers have a net worth of 50 percent more than light smokers and make 100 percent more than heavy smokers. If your health isn’t a factor in helping you quit smoking, the amount of money you miss out on should be. This is one of the factors you do have a say in.
