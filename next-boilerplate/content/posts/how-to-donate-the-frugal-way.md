[The 2008 financial crisis hit many Americans hard](https://bancroft.berkeley.edu/ROHO/projects/debt/financialcrisis.html), making life hard for millions of individuals across the country. On top of that, there are many organizations that are struggling to raise enough cash to help feed the homeless or simply come up with enough research money to go into discovering a cure for a disease. If you’re on a budget, there are ways you can help out without breaking the bank.

## In-Store Donation Options

Lots of stores usually have a jar situated at the checkout counter where you can drop some spare change into to help different causes. In other stores, the cashier would ask you if you’d like to donate a dollar to a special cause. Alternatively, consider purchasing canned food and leaving it by the collection point outside the store. These are usually picked up by various organizations who are interested in feeding a particular group of people such as the homeless and at-risk teens.

## Donate Your Expertise

A great way of spending zero dollars but still getting in on the help train is to donate your expertise to organizations that need it. Struggling groups who may need accounting help for example could really use someone with this kind of expertise who is ready to work for free. The upshot to volunteering is that you’ll get to meet and network with individuals who will benefit your professional life, opening you up to lucrative opportunities in the future should you need them.

## Donate Your Time

Organizations in need usually don’t have the funds to hire someone to carry out different tasks such as cleaning up after the people they take care of or cooking on a regular basis. By donating your time, you get to garner priceless life experience that can help you through life with regard to things like flexibility, compassion and empathy.

## Pack Up and Donate Stuff

If you look around your home, you’re bound to identify stuff that’s probably just cluttering up your home. These items may be in need in places such as orphanages and homeless shelters. Pay attention to necessities such as blankets, plates, cups, children’s toys and books since these are what’s needed the most. If you want to be more effective, call ahead and ask them what they have a shortage of and base your list off theirs.

## Medical Donations

Organizations such as [the Red Cross](https://www.icrc.org/en) are always looking for medical donations, specifically blood. If you’re healthy, consider making multiple donations every month. If you’d like something that pays you back, consider making plasma donations. Please be aware that the former takes a bit more time, so be prepared to spend quite a bit of your time at hospital to get this done.

At the end of the day, donating doesn’t really have to be about money. There are other intangible and abstract ways you can do so, all the while making sure that you’re well on your way to maintaining your financial goals regardless of whichever way you choose to offer help to those that need it.
