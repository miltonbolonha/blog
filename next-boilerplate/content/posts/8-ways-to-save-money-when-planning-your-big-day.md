### Research

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4104" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_4104" style="width: 700px">

It all starts with research. Don’t just go to the first photographer you see listed in your area. Just like hiring a plumber or an electrician, you want to know about your photographer, what they cost, what services they provide and anything else associated with it. You can also go over their portfolio to see if it is a style you love. Always make sure to look into the actual services though, as one might through in engagement photographs for free, while someone else might not provide this service and offer only a few hours with of photography on your wedding day.

### Look Towards the Off-Season

Now, you shouldn’t change your wedding planning just for the photographer. However, if you are looking for ways to have an amazing wedding and save money all around, look towards having a wedding offseason. Just about everything you book will be cheaper, including a photographer. You can also look at having your wedding on a Friday or a Sunday. Saturday weddings are the most common and also the most expensive. If you go for a Friday or Sunday your photographer will be able to work two weddings over the weekend and will likely drop down your price, even though you receive the same services as the person who has their wedding during the week.

### Price Range

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4107" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_4107" style="width: 700px">

You have a price range that you can afford. Don’t go over it. Sure, someone might take the most incredible photographs in the world, but if you can’t afford it, you should avoid it. While asking someone to reduce their price may seem like an option, it generally isn’t all that tactful (especially if it is substantially less). When you see those beautiful photographs, it takes far more work in the editing room working on every picture than what others put in, which is why the price point increases. You also pay more for experience and these individuals likely are booked up in advance. Asking them to go less when they are already a popular photographer will result in a no as they can find someone else to book the same weekend for their going rate.

### Ask for Referrals

Now, if you love the photographer but you know they are out of your price range, you can ask them if they know anyone else who is good for your price point. Many photographers will be more than willing to point you in the direction of quality photographers for a price more in your liking. When you find those who are in your price point, you need to make sure they are able to provide the style or look you’re going for. You should always meet up with the photographer you are interested in so you can talk over your vision face to face. It is far easier to do this than to shoot each other emails back and forth.

### Skip the Other Events

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4109" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_4109" style="width: 700px">

You will have all sorts of events leading up to your wedding. This can include showers, parties, rehearsal dinners and so on. You don’t need to have your photographer for all of these. In fact, this is just a large amount of money you’ll pay you don’t need to. The wedding is the main event and you should save your money for the main event. There are plenty of family members who can snap pictures of you opening gifts or performing other activities. Your wedding is going to be what you look at pictures of further on down the road, and while having some beautiful photographs from the other events is nice, if you want to trim off money from the wedding costs, look towards only using the photographer at the wedding.

### Up and Comers

The established photographer will charge more. They have a larger client base and they are able to charge more because more people want them. Newer photographers don’t have this kind of client base and so they need to charge less while they build their name and their portfolio. There is nothing wrong with going with an up and comer photographer. Now, they will not have as much experience with events or situations at weddings. If you ask a photographer they will tell you all sorts of crazy stories and what they had to do to deal with the situation. While the new photographer won’t have that kind of experience, they can make up for it with enthusiasm. Of course, you don’t want to just hire the newest photographer just because they are cheap and new. Look over their portfolio. They might not have many wedding photographs, so look at other portraits they have taken. Taking pictures of the human form is different from a stationary image, so make sure they have a solid portfolio of these pictures. You may just find you have found someone who will be going onto bigger and better things, you just happened to catch them at their early stages.

### Print Your Photos

Your photographer will provide the option of printing out [photographs](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/charles-tran/5-ways-to-save-money-on-a_b_3055500.html). They usually have the prints listed on the website and your family members can order prints from the photographer. This ads up quickly. Instead, you need to look towards printing out the photographs yourself. A quality photo printer now days costs very little and you can print out these pictures for yourself in your own home.

### Go With a Friend

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4112" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_4112" style="width: 700px">

So you probably won’t receive the same beautiful quality you will with a professional. But it is a cheap option to go with and one thing to consider. If you are on a very tight budget for your photographs and wedding in general this might be your best option.
