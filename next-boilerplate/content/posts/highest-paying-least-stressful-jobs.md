Most people need to work to make money, and many tend to just focus on their careers. However, it’s equally important to focus on your lifestyle: your leisure time, time with your family, your health, pleasures in life, and your spiritual development. If an opportunity arose, many people would strive for two goals in life: make lots of money and have less stress. Having a great work-life balance is an important lifestyle choice that everyone should strive to achieve. However, many career choices don’t afford that opportunity.

If you’re just entering the job market or are considering a change, then you may want to consider one of these low stress and higher paying positions, according to Business Insider and CareerCast.
