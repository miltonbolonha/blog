_<span style="color: #000000;">**A word of caution:** Always read the fine print when downloading apps that claim to help you make money. While, for the most part, apps downloaded from the Apple App Store and Google’s Play Store are fairly safe because of Apple and Google’s security measures, some of these apps will give you money in exchange for information you didn’t know you were sharing.</span>_
