### COLLEGE SHOPPING

![Financially Smart College shopping](/posts/bigstock-Perspective-Students-83957537-1024x681.jpg)  
Perhaps your teenager often says “I know, I know, I know!” So what advise can you tell your teen that he or she doesn’t already know? This is the appropriate age to guide your child in the cost of college, credit cards, taxes, and IRA’s. _Money as You Grow_, an initiative from the President’s Advisory Council on Financial Capability, provides parents with financially smart lessons with associated activities that children need to learn. The financially smart lessons and activities on the following pages are based on years of research, and drawn from dozens of academic studies.

**Financially Smart Lesson**: Cost is a major factor to consider when comparing colleges.

**Activities to reach milestone**:

- Explain that kids that graduate college can earn about twice as much as money as compared to those who did not receive a college degree.
- Discuss with your child how much money you can contribute to your child’s college tuition and expenses each year.
- There are many loans, scholarships, and grants available to your child. Check out [Federal Aid](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/). Use their calculators to estimate monthly loan payments.
- Go on-line with your child and compare [college costs](/way-too-easy-strategies-to-reduce-the-cost-of-college), and other factors so you and your child can see the big picture. You will also want to look at the colleges’ graduation rate, average monthly loan payment, loan default rate, and employment prospects. Visit the U.S. Department of Education”[College Scorecard](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/)“
- Since many parents don’t pay the tuition “sticker price,” look for the “net price calculator” on the college’s website.
- To estimate the parent’s and student’s financial aid, use the Free Application for Federal Student Aid [FAFSA tools](https://fafsa.ed.gov/).

### CREDIT CARD PRIMER

**Financially Smart Lesson**: Avoid using a credit card to buy something you can’t afford

**Activities to reach milestone**:

- Teach your child a budget and create an [income and expenses budgeting worksheet](https://www.mymoney.gov/spend/Pages/spend.aspx).
- Discuss with your child why having a savings and spending plan in place may help avoid using credit cards.
- Explain that whenever you use a credit card, try to pay off the balance in full every month. If not, you may be charged a high interest rate on the balance. Also discuss the monetary and credit consequences if your child is late making a payment.
- Show your child how long it could take to repay a $500 credit card debt by making the minimum monthly payments. [Check out this calculator](https://www.bankrate.com/calculators/credit-cards/credit-card-payoff-calculator.aspx).

### TAXES

**Financially Smart Lesson**: What is take-home pay?

**Activities to reach milestone**:

- Discuss with your child what is “gross pay”, that is money earned before taxes are taken out and what is “net pay”, the amount of money you actually take home.
- Explain a W-4 form, which is required to be filled out before starting a job. The W-4 determines the amount of taxes deducted from a paycheck.
- Discuss what taxes pay for, including schools, police, road repair, and medical assistance (disability).
- If your child gets a steady job, set up an automatic savings program for your child so that at least 10% of his or her earnings goes directly into a savings account.

### IRA ACCOUNT

![Financially Smart IRA ](/posts/bigstock-Young-people-putting-money-in-23704928.jpg)  
**Financially Smart Lesson**: A great place to save and invest earnings is in a Roth IRA.

**Activities to reach milestone**:

- Once your child gets a job, explain the benefits of opening a Roth Individual Retirement Account, which allows the interest he or she earns to grow tax free for life.
- Explain to your child that once he or she starts working, their company may offer a similar account at work: a 401(k) plan. Some companies may provide matching contributions.
