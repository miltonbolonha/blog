However, if you were to wait even a couple months, there is no guarantee these fantastic deals will still be available.

## Why SUV Prices Have Dropped so Low

SUVs have become more affordable in recent months due to several factors. The ongoing worldwide pandemic combined with cash-strapped consumers has led to historically low prices on select SUVs as well as other vehicles. Though most SUV-seekers are unaware of it, the truth is auto dealers are stuck with an abundance of unsold automobiles. These dealerships are attempting to clear out inventory in anticipation of the upcoming 2021 models. This is the perfect opportunity for internet users to land a gorgeous new SUV for a fraction of the regular cost.

Shifts in market demand combined with overproduction of SUVs has left auto dealers with an excess of inventory. This is a fairly rare situation that occurs every now and then yet might not arise again for several more years or even decades into the future. If you have been holding off on the purchase of your dream SUV, today is the day to pull the trigger on a purchase. From luxury SUVs with all sorts of fancy features and premium materials to regular SUVs without as many bells and whistles and beyond, there are countless low-cost options on the current market. Even some crossovers are priced at rock bottom prices that might not be seen again for multiple years or possibly even an entire decade or longer.

## SUV Demand has Been Rising yet Supply is Even Higher

It is no secret the masses covet SUVs. Sedans, coupes, sports cars and other vehicle types are no longer en vogue. There is an ever-increasing demand for SUVs yet the market is overloaded with these vehicles, largely because auto dealers are aware that there is a seemingly insatiable demand for the vehicles. Furthermore, there is an abundance of used SUVs that are still relatively new with surprisingly few miles on the odometer. Add in the fact that automakers have dramatically ramped up the production of SUVs and there is even more reason for auto-seekers to act now, taking full advantage of these potentially once-in-a-lifetime low prices.

As an example, SUV-seekers should consider purchasing the Mazda CX-5, a vehicle available at a 0% interest rate across 60 months along with a $500 bonus with monthly payments as low as a mere $199<sup>1</sup>. The Jeep Grand Cherokee is another fantastic opportunity for those covering a SUV. Available with 0% for 60 months, the Cherokee also provides some icing on the metaphorical cake with a $3,000 bonus cashback award that lowers monthly payments to an affordable $269 per month<sup>2</sup>. Even the uber-popular Nissan Rogue is available at a surprisingly low $199 per month, a deal complete with a $500 bonus and 0% across 60 months<sup>3</sup>. Those on the prowl for a luxury SUV will immediately fall in love with the Acura RDX, an upscale vehicle available for a mere $379 per month<sup>4</sup>. If you have always dreamed of driving a BMW, now is the time to buy one. In particular, the BMW X3 is available for a mere $479 per month<sup>5</sup>.

## Start Your Search Online

The days of walking into a brick-and-mortar auto dealership to buy a new SUV are quickly fading away. Nowadays, more buyers are turning to the internet to purchase a new SUV or other automobile. Perform a search for your new SUV on the web and you will learn all about the incentives provided by local auto dealers, finding it is quite easy to compare prices between models.
