### Leave the Can

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3902" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_3902" style="width: 700px">

![1 Leave the Can](/posts/1-Leave-the-Can.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3902">[withGod](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-81402448/stock-photo-moscow-may-unidentified-air-hostess-of-aeroflot-serves-drinks-out-on-board-from-irkutsk-to.html)</figcaption></figure>

Here the first of many good perks. If you are like most people, you’re probably just a little bit disappointed when all you receive is a half-cup of soda. Unless you bring your own bottle or refreshment onboard with you, these four ounces of liquid isn’t going to last, and pacing yourself with a handful of peanuts and a third of a can of Coke just doesn’t seem to cut it. Well, while you should still pace yourself so you’re not up using the restroom every hour, ask the flight attendant for the full can. Most of the time this isn’t a big deal. Unless the plane is running extremely low on a particular item, they will more than likely hand over the full can.

### Tour the Cockpit

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3903" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_3903" style="width: 700px">

Ever wanted to tour the cockpit? If you are curious, or if you have kids, this really is a great chance to see where the magic happens. You may have heard somewhere along the line you can’t take this tour any longer. This actually is not true, it just depends on timing. Yes, you can’t go into the cockpit while in flight. However, if you ask the crew for a tour after the flight, they may show it off to you (again, having some wee little ones with you always helps). If the crew doesn’t need to turn around right away for another flight, there’s a good chance you will be inside the cockpit in no time.

### Hot Chocolate

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3904" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_3904" style="width: 700px">

![3 hot chocolate](/wp-content/up%0Aloads/2016/08/3-hot-chocolate.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3904">[shebeko](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-118757212/stock-photo-hot-chocolate-with-marshmallows.html)</figcaption></figure>

This isn’t something they often say is available when offering hot beverages, but almost all airlines have hot chocolate available. Maybe you’re cold and don’t feel like all the caffeine. Perhaps you have kids and you want to give them a nice perk for being good on the flight. Whatever the reason is, ask the flight attendant for some hot chocolate. There often is nothing better than sipping on a nice cup of hot chocolate.

### Extra Snacks

Maybe you have a second flight to catch and not enough time to stop off for a sandwich in the airport. Or perhaps you’re just really, really hungry. Ask for some extra snacks. That second bag of peanuts might not seem like much, but it really can help hold you over (especially if you have that full can of Sprint at your side).

### Airport Lounge

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3906" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_3906" style="width: 700px">

![5 Airport Lounge](/posts/5-Airport-Lounge.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3906">[sorbis](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-258588446/stock-photo-dubai-uae-april-airport-interior-dubai-international-airport-is-a-major-international.html)</figcaption></figure>

This is something you need to check on, but it can make sitting around the airport before your flight so much more comfortable. You may even want to arrive early. Many credit cards now have deals with specific airlines, so if you’re flying with the airline and have the accepted credit card on hand, you can enter the lounge. Domestic lounges have snacks, free Internet and much better seating, while larger city lounges may include showers and individual rooms. American Express even has specific AMEX lounges around the world in international terminals. So, check your credit cards and your airports to see if you are able to enter.

### Junior Flyer Pin

There was a time in the earlier days of aviation where it was an almost romanticized form of transportation. While much of that is gone (unless you’re in the super business class) there are still a few remaining perks. Ask the flight attendant if they hand out logo pins. This little pin is a fun little item for your child. Similar to the police badges some police departments give out to children, it is just gift to have.

### Virgin Flyers Drink Free

Trying to decide between flying Virgin Atlantic or another carrier? Here’s one thing that might push you towards Virgin. Every passenger is able to receive at least one free drink (yes, alcohol included). Longer flights, such as international flights, come with more. If you have a child under 12, they receive some rather incredible meals from a Cooking Channel host. While this is airline specific, it is a great way to stretch your legs and have a nice beverage to melt some of the time away.

### Free Internet

Before you take your next flight, check out Boingo Wireless. This is a major Internet service provider not only for airports but for planes as well. Many credit cards offer free Boingo accounts, and even checking out the website can bring about some major perks. Sign up for this ahead of time and you’ll be able to surf the Web without paying the crazy access fees some airlines like to charge.

### Bathroom Products

Just realized you packed all of your bathroom essentials in the checked luggage and you really, really need a toothbrush? If you’re on an international flight ask the flight attendants. They will have everything you need, from a toothbrush to toothpaste, face wash and really everything else in between, if you need it they will have it.

### Wet Wipes

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3911" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_3911" style="width: 700px">

![10 Wet Wipes](/posts/10-Wet-Wipes.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3911">[Matej_Kastelic](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-340124870/stock-photo-interior-of-large-passengers-airplane-with-people-on-seats-and-stewardess-in-uniform-walking-the.html)

It might not sound like much, but the wet wipes may just be your best friend. It is hard to tell who has used the seat and tray table before you, and often times planes are simply gassed back up and turned around to be sent out immediately, so there isn’t exactly a ton of time to clean everything. Outside of general trash removal, that’s about it. Well, if you want to play it safe, ask for wet wipes. This way, you can clean off the table and rest a bit easier, without worrying you might come down with a cold before you arrive for your dream trip. Carrying your own is a nice idea whenever traveling, but the flight attendants can help you out if you don’t have any on hand.
