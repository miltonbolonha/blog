Here’s some valuable tools that should be in every car.

An ordinary flashlight will not due in case of an emergency. Having a compact and very highly efficient LED in your glove compartment, center console, on your belt, or any other convenient place near your side may save your life. Several manufactures market a flashlight with with variable setting including high, medium, low, SOS, and strobe modes. The SOS mode may used to signal a distress and alert rescuers; the strobe mode may be used to disorient an imminent threat; a zoom feature may be used to highlight or focus on a distant object.

Instead of discarding that old cell phone or one with a cracked screen, why not keep that cell phone plugged into one of your car’s AC outlet and use it in case of an emergency? As long as your cell phone can receive a signal, the driver can make a emergency 911 call without having to subscribe to a cell phone plan. Install it in your adult child’s car or your parent’s car. Total cost: $0.

Most new smartphones have a way to call 911 and summon help by just yelling at the device. This feature is very helpful if an individual gets trapped in their car and he/she can’t physically reach their phone and call for assistance. All that is needed is to set up voice activation.

Have an [iphone](https://www.siriuserguide.com/setting-up-siri/)? Just go to Settings ⇒General⇒Siri. Then say “Hey Siri” and tell her to dial 911.
