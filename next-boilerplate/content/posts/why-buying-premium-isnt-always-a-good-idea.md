There’s an old adage that has been around since the turn of the last century or maybe even longer. Quality, it seems, is directly proportional to price even when the evidence doesn’t point to this. We have been primed to believe that we’ll get a better quality item if we pony up. A lot of us do so, albeit grudgingly. If you’re living on a tight budget, you may find it hard or close to impossible to pay more for quality. In this post, we’ll give you tips on how to get quality items or services without having to shell out mountains of money.

## Patience Should Be Your Best Friend

Patience, especially when it comes to purchasing a coveted item can go a long way in ensuring that you stay true to your financial goals and budget. Most items are usually priced much higher the moment they hit the market. This is because manufacturers and marketers know that there is a huge demand for these products and that people are willing to pony up whatever price to have their hands on that particular item. Wait a few months to a year, and the price will plummet just enough for you to afford it.

## Research and Compare

Due to the massive competition between stores and brands these days, there are always offers flying around to entice buyers to buy a certain brand’s item. [This competition is good for the consumer](https://www.wsj.com/articles/competition-good-for-consumers-less-for-capitalists-letters-to-the-editor-1411158314) since you get to compare prices and choose one that fits your budget. Sign up for reminders on comparison websites, and install browser add-ons that track offers for you so you can get the best deal in the long run.

## Set Up a Specific Savings Fund

Paying a large amount of money for an item can seem soul-draining and painful. If you’re really set on making a certain purchase, set up a savings fund where you’ll get to deposit a certain amount of money in it until you reach your goal. This way, you’re able to break down the item price, making it seem not as expensive.

## Consider Getting the Same Item but From another Brand

Branding is big business. At the same time, a certain branded item doesn’t necessary trump others with regard to quality. Unless you’re crazy about labels, you should consider shopping around and considering other brands that have the same, if not better quality of item you’d like to purchase.

## Exceptions to the Rule

Sometimes, [it’s a good idea to pay the price if you’re looking to purchase quality](https://moneybulldog.co.uk/the-things-that-are-worth-paying-a-bit-extra-for/). This is especially true of items that you use on a daily basis such as electronics and clothing. These items, if bought for cheap can fall apart in months or less than a year, sending you back to the store to buy more which in the end may ruin your budget.

By shopping smart, doing your research and refusing to be drawn into the Joneses’ world, you may be able to get all the quality items you need, all the while keeping your budget intact for a long time to come.
