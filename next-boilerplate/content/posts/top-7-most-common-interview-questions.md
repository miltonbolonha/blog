### Tell me about yourself

When asked, this seems like an open ended question. While it may be worded differently, you’ll almost always receive this kind of a question. Basically, your potential employer wants to understand you a little bit. It is also one question may applicants stumble over. Thankfully, you can practice it a bit (because it is so common). Create an elevator pitch. This is a two minute or so introduction to yourself. The elevator pitch idea works for just about everything (telling your boss about a new project, selling a story and so on). This way, you can keep it concise without missing out anything important. However, try not to simply repeat everything, word for word, by memory. You’ll sound like a machine. Rehearse your bullet points and everything will be fine.

### What kind of salary are you looking for?

This is a tricky question. Say too much and you may price yourself out of a job. Say too little and you’ll be underpaid. Don’t just ballpark a number though. Do your research. Look into what the average is for someone in the position you’re applying for. Make sure to keep in mind location as well (someone working in a large city will likely make more than a rural area due to the cost of living). Just don’t say the number first. Let them throw out a number first (this is an essential negotiation strategy for just about anything, including salary).

### Why are you leaving your current job?

With this question, honesty is the best option, but don’t go negative. You don’t need to go into great detail, but avoid talking down on your current company.

### Do you have any questions?

Whenever an interview ends you’ll likely be asked if you have any questions. Always, always have at least one question. By having at least one question it shows you have done your research and that you are engaging, both of which are perks. Throughout the course of the interview you’ll probably have a few of your questions answered along the way. Keep one question tucked away though for when you’re asked this (you will be asked this). This question alone is why you need to research your company before going in for the interview.

### What is your biggest weakness?

Knowing your faults can be difficult. Admitting them is even more difficult. If you don’t prepare for this question you may find yourself in trouble. If you prepare, you can ace this question. Focus on something you’ve struggled with in the past but you’re working on. You can talk about past challenges and how you’ve been bettering yourself to improve upon these weaknesses. Companies want to know if you have the ability to identify your own shortcomings. Knowing that you not only can identify them but work on them is a major bonus.

### What is your greatest strength?

Who doesn’t like bragging about themselves? Don’t talk about everything, but pick a skill or two that is specific to the job you’re applying for. Whether it is going the extra mile to make sure a project is perfect of focusing on details, stick to what works with your potential new job. Also, provide details as to how you’ve done this in the past. Everything is just hearsay unless you provide an example.

### Why are you interested in this company?

This is any question where researching the company is important. Don’t give a generic answer. Those conducting interviews have heard them all and can tell when you’re just saying a general answer or if you’ve actually looked into the business. Look deep into the company. Don’t just do a 10 minute skim on a search engine. Anyone can do that. Putting in the research shows you are serious about the job while also demonstrating your skill at identifying important information most others will not discover. This can go a long way in helping you land the job.
