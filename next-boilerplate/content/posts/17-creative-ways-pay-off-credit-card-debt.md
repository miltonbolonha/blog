### Pay your credit cards weekly

Use your bank’s online tools to make four weekly payments instead of one monthly payment. It will be easier to track and adjust the smaller payments, and you’ll save a small amount in interest since interest will not accrue on the portion of the bill you pay each week.

### Use half of any “bonus” money to pay off your cards

A bonus at work, gifts, or money earned from working overtime should be used to pay off your cards. Use half of what you make to pay off debt, put a quarter in savings, and use the remaining quarter on something fun.

### Start a business

Providing cleaning services, landscaping, or babysitting can be a good way to earn some extra money and get your debts paid off. If the business really takes off, you may even be able to quit your job.

### Pick up more work

Ask for overtime or work as a consultant in your field. While you may not always be able to get more hours, the ones you do get can go directly towards paying off your debt.

### Clean out your closets

Old clothing can be sold to thrift stores or hold a yard sale and sell everything in your house that you haven’t used in over a year. Cutting down on so much stuff will give you more space in your home and earn some money.

### Automatically reroute your paycheck

Some banks will allow you to take a payroll deduction to pay off a credit card. If your bank doesn’t do this, redirect a portion of your check into a savings account that you use to pay off your credit cards.

### Save all your money

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4031" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_4031" style="width: 700px">

This is a good trick for people who think they can’t save anything. Instead of depositing your paycheck into a checking account, deposit the whole thing into a savings account. Then, transfer the money you need to pay your bills into checking along with a small amount to pay for “fun” things. The rest of your paycheck will stay in savings. Having to go through the extra step of transferring more money will make it harder for you to spend everything. At the end of each month, use 10% of whatever is in your savings account to pay down your credit card.

### Pay off your small debts first

By focusing on eliminating your small credit card bills, it will be easier to stay motivated to pay off your entire debt. As you pay off each card, use the money that you were spending for that card to the next largest debt.

### Save your change
