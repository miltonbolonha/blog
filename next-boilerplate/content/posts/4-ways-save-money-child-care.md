Many YMCA’s offers programs for Grades K – 6, Monday-Friday on regular school days, before and after school care, and on school release days. Check for a center near you.

Coordinating babysitting with another mom can help you both save on child care. The cost to care for two children is higher than for the care of a single child, but when two families split the total cost, it’s less expensive than employing two separate babysitters. The children also benefit by increasing their social interaction with another child.

### BABYSITTING EXCHANGE

If a parent is looking to run an errand, work at home for a period of uninterrupted time, or just enjoy a date night, swapping babysitting hours with another parent can be an affordable solution for those occasional babysitting needs. This is another way to save money on child care.

Creating or joining a babysitting co-op in your area may be an affordable option to consider, as compared to a private daycare center. When you join a co-op, the members trade instead of paying. Members get free babysitting in return for providing free babysitting for others. [Click here](https://www.babycenter.com/0_babysitting-co-ops_51.bc) to see how you set up a baby co-op. Also, check out websites such as [Babysitter Exchange](https://www.babysitterexchange.com/servlet/Main.jsp) and [Sitting Around](https://www.sittingaround.com/) which can help set up and manage a co-op.
