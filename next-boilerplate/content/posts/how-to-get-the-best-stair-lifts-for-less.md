Stair lifts can become a necessity for many people once they reach a certain age. These are of course platforms that can carry an individual up and down a flight of stairs, thereby allowing them to change floor with the use of a wheelchair, or without needing to place a lot of extra weight on their knees.

![](/posts/walking-up-stairsjpg-1024x763.jpg)There are many considerations to take into account when choosing a stair lift. For example, you need to ensure that the stair lift is going to provide easy access for you, as well as for anyone else who may **not** require the lift in order to get up and down. Likewise, you need to consider the amount of time it takes to travel from the top of the stairs to the bottom (and vice versa), as well as whether the same stair lift is likely to be suitable for you in 10 years’ time.

## Some Important Points About Stair Lifts

The first thing to consider is the type of stair lift you plan on buying. For example, do you invest in a standing or sitting stair lift? Do you need a stair lift that can carry a wheelchair as well?

A standing stair lift will essentially allow you to step onto a platform and will then carry you up the stairs. As long as you are comfortable standing for this duration, this can actually be the easier option as you don’t need to get into a deep seat. A compromise solution is something called a “perch stair lift,” which will effectively have you in a half-standing, and half seated position. In all case, there should be a seatbelt or other harness to keep you strapped in.

This is where it can be important to think about your situation in 5 years’ time. While you might be happy with a standing stair lift right now, it’s possible it would be more sensible to install a seated stair lift to ensure you can use it for a long time.

Another consideration is whether the stair lift is going to go in a straight line, or whether it is going to go around corners. This will of course depend on the nature of your home. Another type of stair lift is the outdoor lift, which will lead up to your home.

### Some Questions to Ask

You need to ask yourself whether you really need a stair lift before you part with your hard-earned cash. If climbing the stairs has become a daily challenge, then you might be inclined to think that a stair lift will offer the right solution. Keep in mind though, that once you stop climbing the stairs daily, you may quickly lose the ability to do so at all.

Fitting a stair lift can be completed in 24 hours in many cases. This means that you don’t necessarily need to invest in a stair lift now in case of future issues. Rather, you can get the stair lift installed as soon as you need it.

You may want to ask a few final questions about the stair lift in question as well, before finalizing your purchase. For example, how much noise does it make? This can be important if you often need to go downstairs during the night and you don’t want to risk waking your other half.

### How to Get Your Stair Lift for Less

A stair lift can be an expensive purchase, but fortunately there are a number of ways to cut back the costs and get the installation for less.

One is to consider a refurbished stair lift<sup>1</sup>. This is a stair lift that has had a previous owner, but which has been thoroughly checked for healthy operation, and had any parts repaired or fixed as necessary. While you might feel uncertain about buying a used item like this, the truth is that most refurbished stair lifts are every bit as reliable and functional as their brand new counterparts. That means you can make a significant saving while still getting the exact same performance – this comes as a recommended strategy.

Another option is to look into tax exemption, grants from governments or charities, and insurance policies. This is an installation that you have been forced to make, owing to your current physical condition. You need to be able to move freely around your home in order to continue looking after yourself – especially if the bathroom is up there! In other words, this is not a luxury but a requirement, and as such, you shouldn’t need to pay full price for it.

Finally, make sure that you check the cost of installation when purchasing. This may not be included in the price, and that can of course impact on the most cost effective solution for you.
