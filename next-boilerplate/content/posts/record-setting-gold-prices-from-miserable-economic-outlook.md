Have you checked the price of gold recently? Well now might be the time to research and find out how to purchase and find the best prices on gold before it keeps on climbing higher. These economic conditions have created a perfect storm for the world’s oldest money to continue increasing in price.

## A Perfect Storm is Brewing

The United States may be in the midst of a perfect storm as the bond yield plunges, the government’s debt surges, and the economic forecast deteriorates. The net effect is a surge in the price in gold that we haven’t seen in eight years. Some analysts are projecting that the price of gold will continue to climb over the next 12 months<sup>1</sup>.

Gold has always been a sought-after metal, not only to make jewelry or as an investment, but it is also used to manufacture some medical devices and electronics. Gold prices didn’t start to fluctuate a lot from its initial $35 per ounce price when Congress passed the Gold Reserve Act back in 1934. But everything changed in 1971 when the US abandoned the gold standard. In 1974, gold prices hit $154 per ounce. What are the drivers that make this highly sought-after precious metal increase in price?

## Global Bank Reserves

Central banks throughout the world hold gold in reserve as well as paper currency. As these banks change their reserves from paper to gold, the price of gold usually rises. It’s interesting to note that many nations’ bank reserves are primarily comprised of only gold<sup>2</sup>!

Global central banks have been buying up the most gold since 1971, according to Bloomberg. Russia has been the leader in this surge. In 2018, central banks bought more gold than any other time since the 70’s<sup>2</sup>.

## The Advantages Of Gold

As a result of all the uncertainties in paper money, central banks have looked to modify their portfolios. During times of market instability and volatility, banks look to “safe haven” assets that can weather the storm. The perception is that these assets can be safe from losses during a volatile market.

Gold meets the central banks’ objectives during these unstable and unsettled times. The banks’ major goals are return of investment, liquidity, and safety.

As an investment, gold has always been known as a “safe haven” asset. During a crisis, gold typically increases in price. There isn’t any credit risk, nor is it associated with any other assets. Therefore, gold is unique in that it can be protected during times of economic uncertainty.

Liquidity is another of the central banks’ objectives. Gold has high liquidity, so it can be easily traded in global markets.

Over the long term, gold has delivered a higher return than many other assets. It therefore can enhance central banks’ risk and return portfolio. It’s been known to be a very effective portfolio diversifier since it really doesn’t correlate to other major reserve bank assets.

## A Delicate Moment For The Economy

Why is there a renewed interest in gold? There are two major reasons: an uncertainty about the worldwide market while the world’s political and international relations are intensifying. Secondly, the intrinsic value of gold as an asset of the reserve banks.

The renewed trade tensions between US and China and other countries are an unknown. If a truce can’t be reached, the global outcome may worsen. Business investment and supply chains may be disrupted. Global production and productivity may slow down. Some foreign markets have seen a deterioration in business confidence. An example is Germany, since it introduced new automobile fuel emission standards.

## Industrial Demand For Gold (Not Just Jewelry)

Gold jewelry accounted for about 50% of gold demand back in 2019 or roughly 4,900 tons according to the World Gold Council<sup>2</sup>. The nations who consumed the most amount of gold jewelry are the US, India, and China.

As mentioned earlier, gold is also used in industry and technology. The industrial and technology sectors account for about 7.5% of gold demand<sup>2</sup>. Gold is a highly efficient conductor of electricity that can carry tiny currents. It is also free of corrosion. Gold is used in GPS, circuit boards, and other precision electronics.

It is also used in medical devices, such as stents. Radioactive gold is used to diagnosis some medical conditions. Gold is affected by supply and demand. As the demand for jewelry and technology increases, the price of gold will also rise.

## Gold Vs. US Dollar Value

There is inverse relationship between the price of gold and the value of the US dollar. A strong US dollar usually keeps the gold price low and more in control. As the dollar starts to weaken, gold prices usually increase because the demand increases: more gold can be purchased when the US dollar becomes weakened.

Inflation occurs when consumer prices rise. When the dollar falls, prices increase. So, as inflation starts to climb, so does gold prices. Gold is therefore looked at as being a hedge against inflation.

## Gold As Investment Protection

When the economy is uncertain or there is a pending recession, individuals will consider investing in gold due to its long-lasting value. As mentioned earlier, gold has always been looked at as being a “safe haven” during uncertain times. As returns on equity, bonds, or real estate fall, investors start to look at investing in gold, which in turn drives up the price. Gold is a hedge against inflation and protects the investor during economic or geo-political turmoil.

## The Bottom Line

Consumers, investment companies, and manufactures have long been and will continue to be in love with gold. The drivers of the price of gold include: personal and industrial demand, the value of the dollar, desire to look at gold as a hedge against inflation, and the quantity of gold being held in the central reserve banks.
