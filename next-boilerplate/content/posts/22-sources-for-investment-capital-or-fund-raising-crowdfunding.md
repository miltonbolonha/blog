There are a growing number of websites dedicated to raising money for creative and entrepreneurial projects, and fund raising.

While Venture Capital (“VC”) companies invest in multi-million companies that are looking for additional sources of capital, and private high-wealth “Angels” invest in start-up companies as seen in the hit TV Show “The Shark Tank,” VC’s and Angels take ownership in the companies they are investing, and many times they want the controlling interest.

There are other alternatives to consider. Many individuals look to the Internet for crowdfunding sites to obtain start-up [capital](/finding-the-money-to-start-your-investment-portfolio). Crowdfunding has the potential to revolutionize how entrepreneurs raise money. Every crowdfunding site targets particular industry segments, for profit, and non-profit. Each crowdfunding site is different and the project creator and investors needs to carefully examine each site’s playbook. For many sites, if people like the proposed project they can pledge money to make it happen. If the project succeeds in reaching its funding goal, all backers’ credit cards are charged when time expires. If the project falls short, no one is charged. Not all crowdfunding sites are created equal. Here’s the breakdown on which may be the right one for you.
