### Don’t Borrow More Than You Can Repay

You’ll need to be up to date with the show in order to understand this reference. Sansa decided to attack Ramsay Bolton, because she was upset and wanted him dead, despite not having enough men. So, she borrowed Littlefinger’s Vale army to defeat Ramsay’s. Worked out pretty well, right? Well, here’s the thing. Littlefinger has a way of getting what he wants, and he’s not just offering up the Vale army for nothing. The fact of the matter is never borrow more than you can repay. Now, who knows what Sansa will be forced to do in order to repay this. Marry Littlefinger and cut Jon Snow out? Have to wait another year before next season to possibly find out, but always keep this in mind.

### Always Repay Your Debts

The Lannister’s really love to remind you “a Lannister always pays his debts.” This is good to keep in mind. Now, not all of the Lannisters are this stand up individuals, but it is a good motto to live by. Pay back your debts, otherwise your debts will swallow you up. This is especially credit card debts. So before you take out more debt, it may be better to pay back your current debts before moving forward.

### Have a History

Arya Stark might be one of the most interesting characters in the entire series. She’s also gone through one of the most in depth storylines that is always twisting and turning. When she wanted to become a “girl with no name,” she found it beyond difficult because nobody knew her. Eventually she bailed, became Arya Stark again and is on her way, but you need to make sure people know you. This means building a credit history so credit providers know who you are. This will become important later when you decide to buy a home or a car.

### Stay On Your Toes

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4367" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_4367" style="width: 700px">

![stay on your toes](/posts/shutterstock_366405779.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-4367">[andrey_popov](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-366405779/stock-photo-cropped-hand-pickpocketing-wallet-of-businessman-outdoors.html)</figcaption></figure>

Yup, back to Arya. When another girl with no name came after her for failure to execute, Arya should have seen her coming as an elderly man, stabbing her with a shank (at least most of the audience saw it coming). In the television show, when someone puts their guard down they tend to not last very long. Arya had been so good about this up until the point of being stabbed, but it shows that if you let your guard down even for an instant and are not at the top of your game, you can be taken advantage of. Protect your financial identity at all cost, as you may end up finding yourself oweing tens of thousands of dollars on credit card purchases you never made.

### Avoid the Mountain

The Mountain has been an evil guy since the first season when he took down his own horse after losing a jousting match. Mountains come in all sorts of shapes and sizes. For many people, it is a mountain of debt. You need to avoid being crushed under this mountain. Always make sure you handle your debts. Even the smallest debt, when left unattended, can turn into a mountain and completely destroy you (or come back from the dead into an even bigger issue all together).

### It Takes Time

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4369" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_4369" style="width: 700px">

![it takes time](/posts/shutterstock_449823880.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-4369">[lovelove](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-449823880/stock-photo-man-waiting-for-gold-business-and-financial-concepts-money-save-money-to-prepare-for-the-future.html)</figcaption></figure>

Whether you are battling back from bankruptcy or just trying to build your credit score in general, it is necessary to take your time. This isn’t something that happens overnight. The Dragon Queen may be in possibly the position of greatest power now, but this isn’t something that happened instantly. She had to go through all sorts of avenues to reach her current point, including being sold into a marriage. You might find yourself at the lowest point possible with your financial history, but if you stick with it, good things will come.

### Make it Big

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4370" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_4370" style="width: 700px">

When making a return, make it big. Jon Snow was as dead as you get, and while most people watching the show assumed he’d be back (it was out of the hands of George R. R. Martin at that point, otherwise he most likely would have stayed dead). If you were hit with bankruptcy, you don’t need to stay down forever. You can come back bigger and better than ever. So don’t be afraid to make a big, grand return. Nobody else needs to see you making the come back and you can do whatever you need to do to make this comeback. In fact, don’t let anyone else get in your way. It is possible to strive for greatness without anyone else knowing what is going on. This way, it becomes even that more of a surprise and a shocker when you burst back onto the scene, as successful as ever. There is nothing wrong with making it big and making your comback grand.

### Learn From the Past

Yes, Bran Stark seemed to age about eight years over the course of what should have been a few months (guess that’s what happens when he isn’t on one full season). However, as the current Three Eyed Raven, he now is able to learn from the past and let it guide him. This is something you need to learn from. You need to look at the past and allow it to guide you. If you see a past mistake you should learn from it. If you have noticed another issue that is preventing you, or may prevent you from being successful financially, do what you can to change it. While the future is locked in stone, it is your stay with what happens to you in the future. Learn from the past.
