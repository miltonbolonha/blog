![Olive oil](/posts/bigstock-picture-of-beautiful-woman-wit-41377942-1024x671.jpg)Extra virgin olive oil is an excellent source of omega-9 fats. Studies have long shown that adding olive oil to a diet can lower risk of developing heart disease, stroke, some cancers, dementia, and can improve an individual’s life expectancy. New research now shows a new benefit of adding olive oil to an individual’s diet: it may counteract the harmful effects of air pollution.

A study conducted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), explained that exposure to airborne “particulate matter” can lead to heart and lung diseases. Particulate matter is a mixture of the small particles and liquid droplets in the air that includes soil or dust particles, organic chemicals, acids, and metals. When the cells that line the interior surface of blood and lymphatic vessels (known as endothelial cells) are not functioning properly, it may lead to hardening of the arteries and a risk for other [cardiovascular diseases](http://moderntips.com/referred-pain-may-save-your-life-look-for-these-signs). So what can be done to thwart the effect of air pollution?

The EPA study was made up of 42 healthy men and women.

- For 4 weeks, the participants received once a day either 3 grams of olive oil (in supplement form), 3 grams of fish oil, or no supplements (control group.) Note: 3 grams is approximately 1/10th of an ounce.
- The participants were then exposed to controlled filtered air. The next day they were exposed to concentrated airborne particulate matter.
- The results of the study showed that there were reductions in the dilation of the the major blood vessel of the upper arm (brachial artery), thereby potentially showing blood cell lining dysfunction in the control group (no supplements) and the fish oil group, but <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> in the olive oil group.
- The study also showed another benefit for the olive oil group. A protein known to help in the break down of blood clots was increased for the olive oil group.

The study’s concluded that the use of olive oil supplements in a diet may protect against the harmful vascular effects of exposure to air pollution particles.
