Many of us read box labels of food ingredients to make sure that what we ingest doesn’t contain additives that may be unhealthy or things we are trying to cut down on, such as carbs. However, many of us often overlook the ingredients contained in skin care and other personal care products. We often assume the ingredients are being regulated by some governmental agency.

Moisturizers, soap, lip balm, sunscreen, cosmetics, perfumes, colognes, toothpaste, nail polish, shampoos and conditioners all penetrate our skin and enter our blood and lymphatic system. Just looking for a sunscreen with a high UVA and UVB protection is not enough. Some of these skin care products’ ingredients probably are not as safe as you would hope.

Environmental Working Group (EWG), a non-profit organization dedicated to protect our health and environment, rated over 60,000 products. Consumers can now search their database and determine a skin care product’s efficacy and what is really being absorbed in our body. EWG evaluated hundreds of safety studies and thousands of ingredient labels to provide consumers their top recommendations for what products <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> to purchase.

According to EWG, the FDA does not require health studies or pre-market testing of the [chemicals or ingredients such as BHT](/cereal-the-good-bad-ugly) that may be contained in personal care products.

Do you know what’s in the products you purchase, how safe these ingredients are for your family, and how they may affect the environment? We now can be better informed.
