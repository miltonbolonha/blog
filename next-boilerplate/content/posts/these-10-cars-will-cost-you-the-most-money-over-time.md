### Subaru Forester

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3790" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_3790" style="width: 700px">

Subaru has a solid reputation for building cars to last. It also has an impressive following. Many people who purchase a Subaru stick with the company for future purchases. With that said, the Forester will cost the average owner over $12,000 to maintain over a 10 year period. This includes everything from regular oil changes to necessary replacements that come about with owning the vehicle.

### Mazda6

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3792" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_3792" style="width: 700px">

As one of the more popular vehicles on the list, some might be surprised to see it here. However, it costs $12,700 to maintain over 10 years. That’s an additional $1,270 every single year to maintain the vehicle. Mazda usually does very well in terms of inexpensive vehicles to maintain, but the Mazda6 is not one of them. You will notice there are a good number of imports on this list, and that is not by accident. Repairs for imports usually is higher because of the imported parts and need for specialized technicians.

### Audi A4 Quattro

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3793" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_3793" style="width: 700px">

![3 Audi A4 Quattro cars](/posts/3-Audi-A4-Quattro-cars.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3793">[Yauhen_D](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-352043495/stock-photo-minsk-belarus-december-model-year-all-new-audi-a-tfsi-on-display-in-the.html)</figcaption></figure>

The Audi just edges out the Mazda6 with a $12,800 price tag in maintenance fees over 10 years. Audi in itself is one of the most expensive auto manufacturers to maintain. High-end imports, especially European, have a large number of tech based problems that come up over time. This is what costs the most to repair and it is why the A4 Quattro makes it so high up the list.

### Ram 1500

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3794" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_3794" style="width: 700px">

![4 ram 1500 cars](/posts/4-ram-1500-cars.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3794">[Darren_Bode](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-244856809/stock-photo-detroit-january-a-didge-ram-pickup-truck-on-display-january-th-at-the-north.html)</figcaption></figure>

This is the only truck to make it on the list. Pickup trucks, when maintained, are able to last a long time. This is because the engines, frames, transmission, and really everything about the truck is designed to tow and haul. So, everything is built to handle more extreme conditions. While the price of pickups has increased at a steady rate over the last two decades (mostly in part to adhere to government regulations requiring improved fuel economy, which in turn mandates more expensive parts to be used), you can drive it longer. The Ram 1500 however costs $13,300 over 10 years to maintain. The issue isn’t specifically with the Ram itself, but Dodge vehicles have a higher need for repairs than other vehicles sharing the same class, and so when comparing with other pickups, this is one thing to consider.

### Dodge Grand Caravan

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3795" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_3795" style="width: 700px">

![5 Dodge Grand Caravan cars](/posts/5-Dodge-Grand-Caravan-cars.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3795">[Ed_Aldridge](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-341468942/stock-photo-miami-beach-fl-usa-november-dodge-grand-caravan-on-display-during-the-miami.html)</figcaption></figure>

The Grand Caravan has been one of the most popular minivans, especially as more families shifted towards SUVs. Additionally, the Grand Caravan is likely short for this world as the Pacifica from Chrysler is coming out and will more than likely mean the end of the Grand Caravan line. Maintenance on the Grand Caravan is one of the highest of all vehicles at $14,500 over 10 years.

### Chevrolet Cobalt

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3796" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_3796" style="width: 700px">

![6 Chevrolet Cobalt cars](/posts/6-Chevrolet-Cobalt-cars.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3796">[miker](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-27558931/stock-photo-minneapolis-march-chevrolet-cobalt-on-display-at-the-minneapolis-international-auto.html)</figcaption></figure>

Yes, this very small vehicle is more expensive to maintain than an Audi, Ram 1500, and Grand Caravan, all of which probably cost twice as much as the Cobalt. The Cobalt, which took over for the Chevy Cavalier is no longer in production, so you should only keep this in mind if you are looking for a used vehicle. It costs over $14,500 to maintain over 10 years, which is about the sticker price of the vehicle. So why is the upkeep on this so high? Inexpensive material is used to produce a cheap car, which means wear and tear is more likely.

### Mercedes Benz E350

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3797" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_3797" style="width: 700px">

![7 Mercedes Benz E350 cars](/posts/7-Mercedes-Benz-E350-cars.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3797">[Don_liu](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-400812850/stock-photo-geneva-march-mercedes-benz-e-e-car-on-display-at-th-international-geneva-motor-show-at.html)</figcaption></figure>

This vehicle is going to set you back around $14,700 over a 10 year period. In fact, Mercedes itself is the second most expensive brand to maintain. So why are some of these high-end imports so high up on the list? The fact of the matter is many of these vehicles are built for people who will buy the car, own it for two to four years, and then buy a new one. Essentially, the vehicles are not built to last but instead to turn heads of wealthier individuals who can afford to trade up every few years.

### Nissan Murano

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3798" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_3798" style="width: 700px">

![8 Nissan Murano cars](/posts/8-Nissan-Murano-cars.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3798">[Kosarev_Alexander](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-83275219/stock-photo-moscow-russia-august-black-car-nissan-murano-at-moscow-international-exhibition-interauto.html)</figcaption></figure>

If you were told when checking out the Nissan Murano that it is one of the most expensive vehicles to maintain over a 10 year period, you might think twice about buying it. You’ll spend The same about as the E350, or $14,700 to maintain it over the next 10 years. So why is this vehicle listed higher than the Mercedes Benz? With a more expensive vehicle you expect the upkeep to be higher. You wouldn’t expect that on a Nissan. So keep this in mind if you’re shopping around.

### BMW 328i

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3799" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_3799" style="width: 700px">

![9 BMW 328i cars](/posts/9-BMW-328i-cars.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3799">[Foottoo](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-232604011/stock-photo-munich-germany-january-bmw-i-and-i-at-the-bmw-world-at-january-in-munich.html)

</figcaption></figure>

BMW is the most expensive automaker to maintain over the course of 10 years. In fact, the average BMW will set you back $17,800 over a 10 year period. This particular model runs $15,600 for a 10 year period, or $1,560 a year. This is nearly a full five grand over the second most expensive auto manufacturer to maintain, which is Mercedes. So, next time you think you really want a German import, remember to consider on top of the sticker price you’re paying another third in maintenance fees.

### Chrysler Sebring

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3800" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_3800" style="width: 700px">

![10 Chrysler Sebring cars](/posts/10-Chrysler-Sebring-cars.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3800">[Art_Konovalov](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-323273888/stock-photo-chelyabinsk-russia-may-motor-car-chrysler-sebring-at-the-city-street.html)</figcaption></figure>

Maybe the Sebring is on the list because it used to be part owned by Mercedes. The Sebring is no longer manufactured, as it was replaced by the Chrysler 200 (you know, the car Eminem drove through Detroit in the two minute Super Bowl commercial a few years ago), and even the 200 is rumored to be on its way out. Regardless, if you are considering buying this vehicle, just remember it costs $17,100 to maintain over 10 years. That’s almost the sticker price of the $22,000 sedan.
