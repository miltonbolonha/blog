There are plenty of ways you are able to cut your expenses, even without making sacrifices. Consider riding a bike to work or packing your own lunch instead of eating out while on the job.

People who are debt free typically are goal driven. Getting out of debt is one such goal you should strive to obtain. Whether it is just a few hundred dollars or tens of thousands of dollars, getting out of debt is something that takes time, but it is well worth it in the long run. Paying off debt will save you hundreds of dollars every month in your expenses, which is money you can put back into your pocket. These kinds of people set goals and stick with it until the goals are accomplished. It is something you need to focus on and do whatever you can to accomplish. When first starting off following a goal, it is difficult as you’ll need to change your line of thought and what you do in life. However, as you go, it will become that much easier to follow through.

### They are Willing to be Patient

There is a reason why patience is a virtue. It is not easily obtained and yet it can have such an amazing impact on your life. People who are debt free are often patient. They realize they can’t just go out and buy anything and everything because they have a piece of plastic that says it is alright. They take their time. They save up and they do what is necessary to earn the necessary money in order to purchase items instead of buying something and going into debt over it. These individuals will walk past the new flashy television screens or gaming devices and not feel inclined to drop money on the item. Understanding it isn’t necessary to just go and buy these items right off the bat is important and it is something you need to learn. It might prove challenging initially. After all, if you are use to buying what you see and like, it is not the easiest thing to do. However, the more you do it and the more you begin feeling comfortable walking past these new items, the easier it becomes and the more patients you develop.

### They Take Responsibility For Their Goals and Actions

Being responsible is more than just showing to work on time and keeping appointments. To be financially responsible you need to put the needs of the household first. To do this, you need to be out of debt. Swimming in debt can affect you and the rest of your family. It will make it challenging to do just about anything. While giving up a few luxuries may seem a bit challenging at first, you need to do what you can to [pay off the debt](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/10-characteristics-of-debt-free-people-2014-02-05). A responsible person lives debt free, or is working at reducing their debt.

### They Do Not Shy Away From Making Sacrifices

One of the most important characteristics of a debt free individual is they are willing to make sacrifices. This may mean going without cable or cutting down on some of the food you purchase at the store. Maybe ridding yourself of the gym membership and running around the block instead.

### They are Money Wise

Now, this doesn’t mean you need to go out and start studying philosophy or anything like that. Instead it is about making wise decisions. Debt free individuals know that debt isn’t a tool. While credit cards can be nice, these people usually don’t think the cards are necessary for their everyday life. They find other ways to pay and to save money. Large payments like mortgages and car payments can eat up income. This is why many people who are debt free instead of buying brand new go for something slightly used, where they pay a fraction of new for a slightly used vehicle. They also pay their money towards debt instead of buying new items. They know ridding themselves of debt faster saves money in the long run.

### They Are Confident in Their Financial Literacy

When you create a money plan you need to believe in the money plan. It is difficult for many people to not only set a money plan, but to follow it. You’ll need to follow your plan often step by step in order to ensure it works out properly. Confidence in this plan is a must. If you are looking to get out of debt you need to create a money plan and follow through with it. It might take a bit of blind faith at first in order to follow the plan. However, this blind faith can turn into confidence quickly, which will push you through the issues that might pop up along the way. Away from this, you must be confident in driving an older car or not going out and buying the latest fashion. This way you can save money and you can take care of your debt without feeling like you need to go our and purchase anything.

### They Fight Their Materialistic Urges

If you are a materialistic person and you just love “things”, it makes it easier to fall into debt. Whether you need to have the latest pair of shoes a brand new car or go for the oversized house, it is all about material items that bring enjoyment. Now, there are some people who are able to afford this and pay for it without a problem. All of this comes down to knowing your limits and understanding what you can afford and what you can’t. In order to break free of debt though you do need to break free of materialism. Besides, most of the items you purchase you don’t actually need and it doesn’t bring any happiness.
