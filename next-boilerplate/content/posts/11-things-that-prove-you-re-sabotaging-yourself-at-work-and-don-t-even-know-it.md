### Multitasking

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3974" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_3974" style="width: 700px">![1 Multitasking sabotaging your career](http://moderntips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/1-Multitasking-sabotaging-your-career.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3974">[Jason\_Salmon](http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-192139406/stock-photo-busy-business-woman-multitasking-in-the-office-with-four-arms.html)

While many believe multitasking is a good thing, it actually can cause all sorts of problems what you accomplish during your day and may be sabotaging your career. Writing up your report, checking your email, and doing jobs at once actually slows you down. Instead of doing one job quickly, you do three or four jobs slowly and less efficiently. There are times you need to multitask, but most of the time it is more of a detriment than helpful.

### Overcommitting

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3975" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_3975" style="width: 700px">![2 Overcommitting sabotaging your career](http://moderntips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/2-Overcommitting-sabotaging-your-career.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3975">[hidsey](http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-261869786/stock-photo-super-busy-calendar-stress.html)</figcaption></figure>

At the office, you probably want to show the hire ups you are willing to go the extra mile. There’s nothing wrong with that, as long as you can handle the workload. If the productivity begins to suffer, or the quality of your work goes down, you need to reduce what you commit to. By doing so, you allow yourself to focus on what is at hand, devote more time to each and ensure you deliver the highest quality work possible. You want your bosses to see the quality of your work, not you handing in less than stellar material time and time again.

### Over Complain

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3977" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_3977" style="width: 700px">![3 Over Complain sabotaging your career](http://moderntips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/3-Over-Complain-sabotaging-your-career.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3977">[photographee.eu](http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-418045876/stock-photo-angry-young-man-complaining-his-psychologist-about-his-problems.html)</figcaption></figure>

Every office has that one person who just complains about everything. This individual has a negative attitude and it can bring down the rest of the office. Don’t be this person. It is fine if you don’t like a particular task or have issue with certain things, but limit your verbal complaints to really important matters. Focus on the positives at the work place instead of the negatives.

### Make Excuses

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3978" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_3978" style="width: 700px">![4 Make Excuses sabotaging your career](http://moderntips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/4-Make-Excuses-sabotaging-your-career.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3978">[eenevski](http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-431537488/stock-photo-stop-excuses-text-concept-isolated-over-white-background.html)</figcaption></figure>

Excuses are excuses. If you don’t finish something, don’t lay on the excuses. It makes you look incapable of taking responsibility. Instead, you need to simply take responsibility. This is a much more attractive quality than being able to worm yourself out of a bad situation. Plus, most employers are able to see through the excuses.

### Show Up Late

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3979" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_3979" style="width: 700px">![5 Show Up Late sabotaging your career](http://moderntips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/5-Show-Up-Late-sabotaging-your-career.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3979">[Master1305](http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-308552396/stock-photo-the-chinese-man-as-businessman-with-a-briefcase-running-in-a-city-street-on-a-background-of-red.html)</figcaption></figure>

If there is one thing that can derail your career faster than anything else it is showing up late constantly. This shows you are not dependable, are unable to adhere to a work schedule and it also demonstrates to not only your boss but others around you that your time is more valuable than everyone else. Accidents happen from time to time, there is no question about it, but once that accident happens two or three times, it no longer is an accident.

### Try to Please Everyone

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3980" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_3980" style="width: 700px">![6 Try to Please Everyone sabotaging your career](http://moderntips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/6-Try-to-Please-Everyone-sabotaging-your-career.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3980">[Monkey\_Business\_Images](http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-129636062/stock-photo-workers-in-distribution-warehouse.html)  
</figcaption></figure>

Now, if you are an intern or a personal assistant, it is your job to do what people tell you to do and to make them happy. Many professionals start out in one of these positions, so there is nothing wrong with that. However, once you move higher up, you can’t be someone who simply tries to please everyone. You need to have a voice and you also need to set your foot down from time to time. If there is something you need to critique and you believe it is for the best of the company and the person, tell them. Of course, some people require a bit more tact to critique than others, so you may need to learn the best way to discuss these kinds of situations with them, but don’t just ignore mistakes or issues because you want to make them happy.

### Apologize For Everything

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3981" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_3981" style="width: 700px">![7 Apologize For Everything sabotaging your career](http://moderntips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/7-Apologize-For-Everything-sabotaging-your-career.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3981">[pathdoc](http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-241322035/stock-photo-closeup-portrait-desperate-young-man-showing-clasped-hands-pretty-please-with-sugar-on-top.html)</figcaption></figure>

If there is a general mistake, than sure, say you are sorry when it affects someone else. However, saying sorry too much can make you look weak and can cause other problems, as well. Your boss may become burned out on your apologies. You may not even realize you are doing this, so try to analyze yourself and what you say on a daily basis. If you find yourself saying sorry too much, try to cut it out.

### Talk Down To Yourself

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3982" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_3982" style="width: 3500px">![8 Talk Down To Yourself sabotaging your career](http://moderntips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/8-Talk-Down-To-Yourself-sabotaging-your-career.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3982">[ivy\_photos](http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-148780343/stock-photo-depressed-girl-holding-her-face-grey-background.html)</figcaption></figure>

You need to be your biggest supporter. If you don’t believe in yourself, who will? You need to have confidence in yourself. You may not have a big head and you might not want to come across as overconfident, which is fine, but you should still, at least internally, talk yourself up. Don’t attack yourself. You should defend yourself. So, if you complete something, stand behind it and don’t belittle yourself.

### Information Overload

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3983" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_3983" style="width: 700px">![9 Information Overload sabotaging your career](http://moderntips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/9-Information-Overload-sabotaging-your-career.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3983">[Alex\_Po](http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-369093563/stock-photo-man-under-stress-because-of-too-much-problems-abstract-image-with-a-wooden-puppet.html)</figcaption></figure>

Ever take in too much information you just can’t concentrate on one thing? This is information overload. Try not to go overboard with the information for certain tasks. Yes, knowledge is power, but in doses. Take on the information for the job at hand. Otherwise you’ll kill your productivity.

### Make All the Decisions

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3984" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_3984" style="width: 700px">![10 Make All the Decisions sabotaging your career](http://moderntips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/10-Make-All-the-Decisions-sabotaging-your-career.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3984">[Kheng\_Guan\_Toh](http://ww.shutterstock.com/pic-327385208/stock-photo-background-concept-wordcloud-illustration-of-analysis-paralysis.html)</figcaption></figure>

If you are making every single decision, it can eventually lead to procrastination and low work productivity. There is such thing as decision fatigue. Let other people make decisions from time to time. Whether it is picking out lunch or the order of your reports. It is an actual relief when someone else takes charge.

### Being a Flake

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3985" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_3985" style="width: 700px">![11 Being a Flake sabotaging your career](http://moderntips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/11-Being-a-Flake-sabotaging-your-career.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3985">[Corepics\_VOF](http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-46625671/stock-photo-laid-back-receptionist-taking-a-call-not-too-seriously.html)</figcaption></figure>

If you say you were going to do something or show up for a dinner or accompany someone to a pitch, don’t flake out. Nobody likes a flake. Sure, there might be a billion different things you’d rather do, but you told someone you’d help out. You gave them your word, and as soon as you show they can’t take you for your word, you are more or less worthless to them as they can no longer count on you. The last thing you want to be is someone nobody can count on (that will kill your career right there). So, if you say you’re going to do something, do it.
