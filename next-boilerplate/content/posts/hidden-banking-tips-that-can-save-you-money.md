Financial institutions are notorious for charging fees when an individual overdraws a check by mistake, makes a deposited check bounces, is late on a payment, or when their [checking](/how-to-get-your-moneys-worth-from-checking-accounts) or savings account falls below a certain balance. Do you get an alert ahead of time?

Banks are imposing such fees because they’re offering more services to the consumer, and these services cost the banks money, says American Bankers Association. “When people say the number of potential fees has increased, it’s kind of disingenuous. We had limited services 30 or 50 years ago when there were no debit cards, no ATMs, no online banking, so there were less fees.”

#### **<span style="text-decoration: underline;">HOW TO SET UP ALERTS</span>**

To help assist their customers, many financial institutions have web-based tools to help better manage their accounts and can email or text alerts before it’s too late. Every financial institution has their alerts page displayed in a different part of their web site and the consumer’s challenge is to search and find where this page is hidden. It gets very frustrating when having more than one bank account. Before getting too frustrated, call your financial institution web support line to better assist you.

For example, **Bank of America** has their alert menu under the customer’s “Profile &amp; Settings” tab (located to the right of your name). Then click “Account Settings” and “Alert Settings” and you’ll be connected to the alert page.![bofa](/posts/bofa.jpg)
