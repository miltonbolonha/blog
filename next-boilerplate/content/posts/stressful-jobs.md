### Working Parents

![working parents stressful jobs](/posts/working-parents-stressful-jobs.jpg) At the top of our list is the working parent. Working parents don’t get additional compensation for being a parent. Often, there isn’t a clear division between the time spent parenting and the time working at their job. Something will have to give since the balance is difficult to achieve. Emotions, stress, and guilt are the by-products of this conflict. Conflicts arise on a daily basis – attending to a child’s needs may conflict with the parents’ work schedule or deadline. Being a single parent only heightens the stress level. Imagine being a working parent and also holding down one of the jobs on the following pages.
