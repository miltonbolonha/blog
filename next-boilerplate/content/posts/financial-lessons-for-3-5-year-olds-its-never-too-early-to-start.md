### Money Primer

![Financial lessons 3-5 year old](/posts/bigstock-Family-Looking-At-Clothes-On-R-92606243.jpg)  
A child is never too young to start teaching financial lessons. An initiative from the President’s Advisory Council on Financial Capability, _Money as You Grow_, provides parents with financial lessons and activities to teach their children. The financial lessons and activities on the following pages are recommended for 3-5 year olds. They’re based on years of research, and drawn from dozens of standards and academic studies.

Here’s the first of 4 financial lessons and activities to teach your child why you need money to buy things.

**Financial Lesson**: You need money to buy stuff

**Activities to reach milestone**:

- Take out some change and identify the coins and value.
- Discuss how you may value something that is free, such as having fun with a friend on a play date.
- Identify items that do cost money, such as ice cream, food, or clothes.

### How Do You Earn Money

**Financial Lesson**: The way to earn money is to work

**Activities to reach milestone**:

- Describe to your child your job or your significant other’s job.
- Drive around your town and point out people working, like the delivery person, a construction worker, or a police officer.
- Explain that some people start their own businesses, like your family restaurant or dry cleaner, and those people are called entrepreneurs.
- Ask your child to think about how he/she could earn money by washing your car, raking leaves, or setting up a lemonade or cookie stand.

### May Not Be Able To Get It Now

**Financial Lesson**: You may have to wait to buy something you want

**Activities to reach milestone**:

- When your child is standing in line at the playground for a turn on the slides, or looking forward to his/her birthday, explain that sometimes we have to wait for things we want.
- Find three jars and label one for “saving”, another for “spending”, and one for “sharing.”
- Suggest that your child put some of the money into the saving jar, so he/she can buy a toy when enough money has been saved.

### Need v. Want

![financial lessosn 3-5 year olds](/posts/bigstock-Happy-family-choosing-dairy-pr-98402117-1024x695.jpg)  
**Financial Lesson**: There is a difference between “need” and “want”  
**Activities to reach milestone**:

- The next time you are out shopping, point out things that are absolutely necessary such as clothing and food. Then ask your child to describe items that he/she may “want” but are really an “option.”
- Discuss with your child how your family decides what to buy and what to pass up. Which is more important, buying cookies or fresh fruit? Soda or milk? What is a nicety and what is a necessity?
- Draw a circle. Divide it into 4 sections: food, rent/house payment, clothes, and “optional items.” Show your child that there is only a finite amount of money to spend.
