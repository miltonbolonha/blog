### Ebates

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3777" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_3777" style="width: 700px">

![1 ebates get paid](/posts/1-ebates-get-paid.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3777">[pathdoc](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-241332013/stock-photo-side-profile-happy-smiling-business-woman-working-online-on-computer-earning-money-dollar-bills.html)</figcaption></figure>

Ebates is one of the best ways to make money whenever you shop. This is a website you create a free account for. You can then install a browser plug-in (this is the easiest way to shop online, although you can search manually for supported stores) so whenever you visit an online store the plug-in asks if you want to activate the Ebates money back feature. Depending on the store, you can get anywhere from one percent to often more than 15 percent. The plug-in does all the work and all you need to do is shop. There are no minimum purchases or anything like that. The money goes into an account on Ebates where you can request either a PayPal transfer or a check mailed to your house.

### Credit Cards

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3779" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_3779" style="width: 700px">

There are plenty of credit cards out there with reward options. These cash back rewards may give you a percentage point on certain items you buy (or everything you buy). Check your credit card to see what kind of rewards you can receive, or check for the right credit card for your credit rating (and what you normally purchase). When you combine the money back percentage with what Ebates offers, you are often going to be receiving 10 percent cash back or more on everything you buy for now on.

### Referral Programs

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3780" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_3780" style="width: 700px">

![3 referral program get paid](/posts/3-referral-program-get-paid.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3780">[michail_petrov](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-310240760/stock-photo--hand-writing-referral-program-with-red-marker-isolated-on-white-background-business-technology.html)</figcaption></figure>

Many websites and stores have referral programs. Through these referral programs you send someone a link, and when they make a purchase you earn money. If you like something you purchased you can post it to your social media or email it to people. Whatever you decide to do, this is a nice way to share the word of what you like to purchase while also receiving money in return from it.

### Survey Websites

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3781" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_3781" style="width: 700px">

![4 survey get paid](/posts/4-survey-get-paid.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3781">[baranq](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-176125589/stock-photo-male-student-taking-some-notes.html)</figcaption></figure>

Survey websites offer a few different money making options. Sites such as TreasureTrooper.com and CashCrate.com make it possible to fill out surveys that take a few minutes and you are paid in the end. These websites also have a cash shopping feature. The cash shopping works much in the same way as Ebates. However, these services usually don’t have a plug-in, which means you need to search the database of available websites to see if where you want to shop is supported. Ebates will have a larger number of available websites, but if you are already making money through the surveys, you can always check out the cash shopping.

### Reward Programs

![5 reward program get paid](/posts/5-reward-program-get-paid-1.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3788">[phushutter](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-327879236/stock-photo-loyalty-program-word-write-on-white-background-by-woman-hand-holding-highlighter-pen.html)</figcaption></figure>

If a website you shop with has a [reward program](https://www.thepennyhoarder.com/cash-back-sites/), make sure to sign up. This gives you points for everything you purchase, giving you money back eventually. While not every website has it, there are plenty that do. Best Buy has a rewards points program, as does DSW, Nordstrom, Expedia and many other sites. Unless you never make purchases through a particular website this might be an excellent option for you to check out.

### GrouponSnap

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3783" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_3783" style="width: 700px">

![6 groupsnap get paid](/posts/6-groupsnap-get-paid.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3783">[gunner_pippel](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-56810611/stock-photo-travel-concept-with-hotel-key-and-tag-or-label.html)</figcaption></figure>

Groupon provides money saving deals online for everything from food to hotels, flights and other forms of transportation. It is a great place to shop and save money. GrouponSnap is a mobile application from the service where you take a picture of your grocery receipt. The application then scans it over to see if there are any discounts on what you purchased. If there are, you receive the small deposit into your create account. This is a nice application to have simply to check your grocery shopping and possibly earn some money back on the side.

### Receipt Hog

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3784" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_3784" style="width: 700px">

![7 receipt hog get paid](/posts/7-receipt-hog-get-paid.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3784">[andrey_popov](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-244879999/stock-photo-pile-of-generic-shopping-receipts-with-costs.html)</figcaption></figure>

Receipt Hog is another free application that works in a similar manor to Groupon. The good thing here is there is no limit on the number of shopping receipt applications you can use, so you may actually receive cash back from both services. Nothing like being paid multiple times over for making the same purchase.

### Swagbucks

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3785" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_3785" style="width: 700px">

![8 swag bucks get paid](/posts/8-swag-bucks-get-paid.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3785">[Jakub_Grygier](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-327209306/stock-photo-perk-word-crowd-from-above.html)</figcaption></figure>

Swagbucks is the search engine you want to check out if you are interested in making money online. The search engine uses Google as its search engine only with its Swagbucks plug-in features over top. Whenever you make searches through the search engine you receive what is called “swag bucks,” which you can trade in for gift cards, discount tickets and other perks. Swagbucks has other features, including video playback where you are awarded swag bucks for watching videos. You can also receive swag bucks for shopping through its shopping service. This works similar to Ebates and the survey shopping websites. If you like the features of Swagbucks and want to find a way to increase your payout, this might be the option for you.

### BeFrugal

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3786" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_3786" style="width: 700px">

![9 befrugal get paid](/posts/9-befrugal-get-paid.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3786">[aastock](https://www.shutterstock.com/pic-187213064/stock-photo-coins-in-savings-jar-full-of-money.html)</figcaption></figure>

BeFrugal is an excellent way you can earn up to 30 percent cash back while shopping online. There are over 4,000 stores registered with the online service and you can receive payments through PayPal or a gift card once you hit $25 in your account. You may be surprised just how quickly you can make it to this amount, especially if you start to make most of your purchases online. Outside of a handful of items, it is possible to buy nearly everything online. If free shipping is included, you might as well buy online so you can receive this nice cash back bonus. Just note that you are only able to use one service, like Ebates or BeFrugal (you can’t use them both on the same purchase). However, you will receive cash back rewards when using a cash back rewards credit card through the buying services.
