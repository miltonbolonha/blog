Everyone is looking for ways to save money on groceries since it is one of our largest expenses. Walmart has a reputation for being a low-price leader. That’s not the case anymore when it comes to purchasing grocery items, according to a new cost comparison survey. The price check shows that a new supermarket chain was about 30% cheaper than Walmart.

The German based Aldi supermarket chain, parent company of Trader Joe’s, has emerged as a low-price leader in many categories. Aldi is short for Albrecht Discount. Business Insider compared the prices of 34 items at an Aldi store in Richmond, VA to an identical set of items at a nearby Walmart store. The findings: Aldi’s shopping cart was approximately 30% less expensive than Walmart’s cart. Also, blogger Erin Kelly conducted a price check at an Aldi market in Manhattan, KS and found Aldi was 22% less expensive than WalMart. “With the exception of the milk and eggs, which usually are cheaper at Aldi, every single item was cheaper at Aldi than Wal-Mart,” Kelly wrote on her blog. “Every penny adds up.”

Here’s some details of the shopping comparison conducted by Business Insider:

- Aldi’s shopping cart totaled $89.48. Walmart’s cart was $115.86. (Note: they accounted for the products’ varying package sizes and calculated those differences into the final price.)
- Aldi was less expensive in fresh produce and packaged goods.
- The biggest price difference was on peanut butter, flour, grapefruit, flour tortillas, butter, quinoa, apples, and coconut oil. Flour was $2.16 cheaper at Aldi, four sticks of butter were $1.28 cheaper, and 16 ounces of quinoa was $2.93 cheaper, compared to Walmart. Aldi’s creamy peanut butter cost $2.99 for 40 ounces and Walmart’s Great Value brand cost $4.37 for the same amount.Three pounds of gala apples cost $2.99 at Aldi and $4.41 at Walmart, and a whole grapefruit cost $0.79 at Aldi and $1.28 at Walmart.
- Walmart was less expensive for 6 items: skinless boneless chicken breasts, tomatoes, organic bananas, milk, and eggs.

When asked to comment about the price check, Walmart spokesman John Forrest Ales noted that Walmart will match prices “advertised” by other retailers.

According to Business Insider, Aldi keeps their prices low by limiting inventory to a lean selection of private-label items and selling very few major brands. They invest less in customer service, and merchandising than traditional markets. Aldi saves money by requiring customers to bring their own shopping bags, bag their own groceries, and pay a $0.25 deposit to use carts. The deposit is refunded when customers return the carts, so Aldi doesn’t have to pay employees to round them up and return them to the front of the store. Aldi Workers don’t have to unpack boxes of groceries to stock them on shelves. The products are delivered in boxes with an open side, so they can be thrown onto a shelf without being unpacked. The end result: Aldi’s customers [save money on groceries](/16-smartphone-apps-that-pay-you).

They just revealed plans to open approximately 600 more stores across the U.S. The first 25 stores will open in Southern California by July 2016.
