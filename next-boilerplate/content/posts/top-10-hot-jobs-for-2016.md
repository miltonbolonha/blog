### DATA SCIENTIST

![data scientist](/posts/data-scientist.jpg)  
Roughly 6,000 companies are expected to hire for an estimated 4.4 million IT jobs with direct ties to data analysis next year, reported CareerCast via Stamford, CN based Gartner. Data science’s hiring boom is tricky to measure, say analysts, because the field is so new that the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics doesn’t yet track specific hiring needs. In addition, the skill sets and responsibilities are still being defined at many companies, which likely will increase the recruiting challenge as hiring managers redefine what they seek on a regular basis.

### ELECTRICAL ENGINEER JOBS

While demand for electrical engineers is expected to be strongest in Chicago, Houston and San Diego, the greatest supply of candidates will likely be in Los Angeles and New York, thus creating an imbalance, reported Randstad US, which also estimates that there are currently 17 openings for every electrical engineering candidate.

### GENERAL AND OPERATIONS MANAGER

To meet the expected 12.4 percent growth in demand that the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics anticipates by 2022, recruiters will have to get busy soon. That growth rate translates into 613,000 open positions to fill for general and operations managers over the next seven years.

### HOME HEALTH AID

Hiring is projected to rise by 48 percent over the next seven years, which the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics says is a direct result of the aging population. Nearly 600,000 positions will need to be filled to meet the expected demand, while the low median salary of $20,820 limits the scope of the candidate pool.

### INFORMATION SECURITY ANALYST

The proliferation of cloud-based technology is a driving force in the need for this job. Microsoft reported that by the beginning of next year, North American companies will need to employ at least 2.7 million cloud-computing workers, including information security analysts, and labor analysts say the supply can’t meet that demand.

### MARKETING MANAGER JOBS

With the explosive growth in digital marketing and an already high average annual salary of $127,130, marketing managers are in very short supply, reported the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Looking to new college graduates to help fill the pipeline won’t suffice, as marketing is one of the skill sets most in demand by college recruiters, according to the National Association of Colleges and Employers.

### MEDICAL SERVICES MANAGER

The requirements for this position overlap the nation’s highest labor shortage industries, as estimated by U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics: health care, social assistance and professional business services. The BLS projects 73,300 new hires will be needed in the field by 2022, and predicts a 23 percent overall increase in employment.

### PHYSICAL THERAPIST JOBS

![jobs](/posts/physical-therapist-1024x680.jpg)  
The American Physical Therapy Association estimates that in 2016, demand for full-time [physical therapists](/which-jobs-have-the-highest-and-lowest-divorce-rate) will exceed 229,000, with a pool of candidates of around 196,000, creating a gap of 33,000 unfilled jobs. Like other health care fields, demand is up due to greater accessibility to health insurance and the aging population.

### REGISTERED NURSE

![nurse](/posts/nurse.jpg)  
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a 19 percent growth rate by 2022, but it also estimates that 525,000 currently working registered nurses will have to be replaced due to retirements, which puts the total number of new hires anticipated at 1.05 million over the next seven years. In addition, the average age of working nurses is expected to rise to 44.6 from the current 42.7.

### SOFTWARE ENGINEER JOBS

![sw engineer](/posts/sw-engineer.jpeg)  
The Conference Board estimates there will be three jobs available for every new college graduate from a computer science program in 2016. There are many positions available as a remote or [virtual office worker](/70-companies-hire-remote-workers-virtual-jobs-uncovered). Not surprising, since the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates 222,600 software engineering jobs will need to be filled by 2022.
