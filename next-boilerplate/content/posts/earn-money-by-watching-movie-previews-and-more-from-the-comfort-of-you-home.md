We’re always looking to make some additional money to save for some emergency, help pay for some unexpected bills, or just have some extra spending money. Here’s a way to earn money by checking out the latest movie trailers, finding some great recipes, getting some tips, or just sitting back in your chair and laugh from the comfort of your home. Watching Swagbucks videos may be your solution.

[Swagbucks](https://www.swagbucks.com/watch) is an online rewards and cash back program. Simply do the things you’d normally do on-line, such as search the web, answer polls, watch videos, play games, and shop. Members accumulate points that are quickly redeemable for cash from PayPal or free gift cards from:

- Target
- Walmart
- Amazon
- Best Buy
- And many more companies

Over $100 million have been awarded to their members. Easy way to earn money. Swagbucks offers new members a $5 sign up bonus.

_Note: There are some unscrupulous companies on the web that are only looking to take money from you. Check users’ feedback and comments on-line before signing up with any company to make sure they are legit._ _Read testimonials from other members. Watch out for survey scam sites. Legitimate companies do not ask members to pay money to sign up._
