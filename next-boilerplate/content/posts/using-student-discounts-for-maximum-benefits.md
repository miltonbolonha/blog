Being a student can be challenging, especially when it comes to finances. Your student years are supposed to be your most fun, and money does play a part in most of the things your average student wants to do to max out their time at college. Student discount cards abound, but not a lot of students know how to use them to get the most out of them. In this post, we’ll take a look at the best ways to get you the best deals while using your student card.

## Transportation

If you have a weekend to spare and would like to head out of campus and have some fun, you may want to take advantage of the various bus companies that accept and give out student cards. Not only is this a great way to save money, it is also an amazing way to see the country especially if you’re heading out with friends.

Some of the bus companies that accept student discount cards include:

- Greyhound

## Shopping

Looking good and having the latest gadgets is something that almost every student aspires towards. However, these items usually cost an arm and a leg, and on a student budget, it’s virtually not possible to go to the mall and shop to your heart’s content. Luckily, some stores such as Apple and J Crew as well as others provide massive discounts to students as long as they are able to present their ID. A great inclusive card to have is the Student Advantage Card which has partnerships with retail giants such as Target, Lenovo, Foot Locker, and Karma Loop. Check it out [here](https://www.studentadvantage.com/discountcard/).

## Shared Accommodation

If you feel that you’ve had enough of campus living and would like a larger place with more privacy, consider shacking up with a friend that you get along with. This will save you money on college accommodation costs as well as teach you a thing or two about independence and responsibility. If you’d like to get discounts on house items, check out the Wal-Mart money card found [here](https://www.walmartmoneycard.com/AcctMgmt/Controls/Walmart/Support/Products.aspx).

## Cell Phone Discounts

If you’re a social butterfly but are worried about racking up a huge phone bill, contacting your carrier can make it possible for you to sign up for a plan that will save you money as well as get you the latest cell phone and related devices.

## Limit the Number of Credit Cards You Own

Credit cards can be incredibly convenient. They can also help you build your FICO score, making it more likely for you to be approved for loans later in life. that being said, signing up for credit cards can put you in more debt since these cards usually come with astronomical interest charges which may take some time to pay off. Resist the temptation to take these cards, or limit yourself to only one.

Lastly, consider purchasing text books using your student discount card since these cost a fortune these days. Alternatively, look into buying used text books from students who have just taken the course and are looking to make some money from selling off their books.

Ultimately, looking around you for different resources available to you as well as asking the right questions can help you bust your budget during your college years effortlessly.
