Thanks to the internet, it’s now possible for anyone to become qualified in practically anything. This gives those willing to take the initiative the opportunity to make themselves significantly more competitive and employable. Why wait for your employer to send you on a training course, when you can study from the comfort of your own home? With an online business degree, you’ll be able to stand out in nearly any industry.

![](../uploads/2021/01/Cv-business-1024x680.jpg)A business degree will teach you the fundamental basics of business. That means you’ll be able to perform better in any role, in any industry. You’ll understand why people buy products, you’ll know how to motivate your team, and you’ll be familiar with concepts like MVP, BOM, USP, and breakeven.

In a time when employees will rarely stick with one employer for their entire careers, it’s increasingly unprofitable for organizations to pay for additional training for their staff. Thus, careers remain stifled and stagnant. By taking initiative and gaining online training, you can demonstrate your commitment, while also opening yourself up to other opportunities and higher-paid positions.

So, what do you need to know about getting a qualification online?

## How to Get an MBA Online

An MBA is a Master of Business Administration, and is generally considered to be one of the most prestigious and sought-after business qualifications. Studying an MBA online is both expensive and time-consuming, but graduates will be able to walk into many more positions once they have completed their study, as well as commanding much higher salaries.

If you are studying an MBA online, then you will have two primary options available to you:

- Executive MBA
- Part-Time MBA

The Part Time MBA is aimed primarily at students between 24-35 years old, who are not yet in leadership positions. The Executive MBA is aimed specifically at managers and above, aged 34-42<sup>1</sup>.

Either way, the MBA will cover a range of topics relating to business, including (but not limited to):

- Corporate finance
- Operations management
- Legal
- Economics
- Financial accounting
- Global strategy
- Professional writing
- Leadership
- Marketing
- Business ethics
- Global strategy

### Online MBA Courses to Consider

If you decide to go ahead with an online MBA course, here are some options to consider.

- MBA Degree: Master’s in Business Administration from Boston University<sup>2</sup>
- MBA – Warrington College of Business<sup>3</sup>
- Executive MBA from University of Virginia<sup>4</sup>

It’s worth investigating precisely which topics will be covered by a given degree. Compare this to the skills listed on job listings that you might potentially be interested in applying to.

You should also check pricing, as well as what distance learning entails. How long do you have to complete the course? How many hours will you be expected to work each week? Assess whether you can fit this online business degree around your lifestyle before making a commitment.

### Bachelor’s Degrees in Business Administration

As mentioned, an MBA is a huge commitment for anyone looking to gain an additional online business degree. Therefore, many readers will be better served by smaller degrees and qualifications.

There are a huge range of different online business degrees available, which include specialist topics as well as more general introductions.

When selecting from any of these, you should look for accreditation. Organizations such as the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSOC)<sup>5</sup> and The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business International (AACSB)<sup>6</sup> offer accreditation to offer some peace of mind.

There are a number of great online undergraduate programs for those looking for business qualifications. For example, The Bachelor of Science in Business Management from Key West University, Jacksonville, offers a full-time 4-year online degree that can be completed remotely<sup>7</sup>.

The Bachelor in Business Management (Online) from Schellhammer Business School in Spain offers a fast-tracked 240-credit course that will take an online student 3 years to complete<sup>8</sup>.

For those looking to invest less time, the BA (Hons) in Business Management from London School of Planning and Management can be completed in 18 months of part-time study<sup>9</sup>. Find the course that best suits your availability, timeframe, and budget. Make sure to also consider the precise modules, and the types of work you are hoping to find after completing the degree when making your choice.

## Tips

Unfortunately, business qualifications have become so in-demand that even some of these are now quite competitive to get onto. The good news, is that you can improve your chances of success with further online training. For example, taking the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT)<sup>10</sup> can actually help you to improve your chances of getting onto the top online business courses. This will give you a score out of 800, where anything above 730 will improve your odds.

For those that don’t have the time to complete a BA or a BSc, another option is to look into shorter courses. If you are already in the workplace and you’re looking for an online qualification that you can obtain while working your regular job, then finding something smaller and more specific may be a better strategy.

For example, a visit to a site like edx.org<sup>11 </sup>will help you to find many shorter courses in specific subjects such as business writing, or business fundamentals. The Business Writing from Berkeley University of California for instance is a $267.30 course that will teach you better communication and help you write more effective emails, letters, and reports. This can perfectly supplement a CV, without requiring a huge time commitment from you: there are three courses lasting four weeks each, and requiring a total commitment of 3-5 hours each week.

This is really the biggest benefit of online learning: you can find any kind of qualification to suit your lifestyle and your goals. Mix and match to build your perfect CV, and leave your peers behind!
