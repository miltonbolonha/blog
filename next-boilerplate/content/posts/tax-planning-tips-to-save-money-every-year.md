Tax season is upon us again, and millions of Americans are rushing to have their affairs in order so they can beat the deadline.

## Combine Business with Pleasure

A great way of making sure that you’re not taxed to your ears is to squeeze in some holiday time during your next business trip. This could be in the form of two extra days of fun in the sun in Mexico on your way back from a London business meeting, or whatever floats your boat. This way, you can write off the holiday as a deduction, as long as you spent half the time away carrying out business-related matters.
