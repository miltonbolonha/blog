Isn’t it great when you take the same drive you always do but you just somehow hit all the green lights. Then, out of nowhere, a yellow pops up. Do you stamp down the gas to make it, or do you take what you’ve been given and just stop? Your work life may be exactly like this. You coast along in the job, enjoying what it has to offer, but then one day, you realize everything has slowed down, and maybe you’ve even come to a stop. You’ve spent so much time in the one career path you didn’t even realize you no longer are moving. Changing your career path is like hitting the gas and taking that yellow. Yes, be cautious, but it can open you up to a brand new way of enjoying new opportunities and a new career.

Experiencing something new and fresh for the first time is incredible. Like that new feeling of falling in love. Everything is just a bit different and fresh. You’re experiencing the same things but with someone different. It’s exciting and exhilarating. All of this is true with a new career path. When you first started, you might have felt excited and thrilled with new challenges, but now, after a decade or two on the job, it may just feel old. Like you are stuck and nothing is changing. You no longer have that thrill you loved. It doesn’t mean you need to remain in the job though and simply accept it.
