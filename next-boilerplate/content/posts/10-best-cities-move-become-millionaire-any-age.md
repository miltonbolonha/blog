Maybe instead of looking for the giant cities on the coast you need to look for more toward the middle of the country. Kansas City has a metro population of over 1.5 million and a median income with at least a bachelor’s degree of nearly $51,000. Rent is lower than other locations at $850. To make money you’ll likely need a job at first, and the unemployment rate for those with a bachelor’s degree is 2.4 percent. With access to infrastructure, jobs and really everything you might need, this is an excellent location to start.
