  After selecting the sites you want to work with, have some reasonable expectations on how much money you will earn. Each job that is contracted pays the same fee regardless of experience. Greutman reported that:

- Restaurant mystery shopper earns between $25 to $100 -Plan to spend about an hour, or however long it may take to eat; and approximately another 30 minutes to complete the [survey](/the-6-best-on-line-survey-sites-that-pay-money/3).
- Phone call and on-line mystery shopper can earn around $3 to $5. Calls and on-line shopping tend to take around 5 minutes. Add an 10 minutes or so to complete a survey. As a mystery shopper gains experience, he/she becomes more proficient filling out surveys and can cut down the time to fill them out.

  ### Figure Out How Much Time Each Task Takes Before Committing![mystery shopper in traffic](/posts/bigstock-urban-traffic-jam-in-a-city-st-94396547-1024x684.jpg)

  Your time is valuable. Factor in travel time, the possibility of getting stuck in traffic, finding a parking spot, time on the job, and the time to complete a survey. Look for shops that will work for your needs and schedule. While it’s great to get another “free meal” at a restaurant, you may benefit more by reviewing the “free haircut” at a beauty salon.

  Note: Start off with one or two shops, fill out the survey, and get feedback. A mystery shopper needs to remember a lot of detail. If your report isn’t accepted, you won’t get paid or be reimbursed for your expenses. Greutman noted that while the “favorite shops were the ones that were at very nice restaurants…being able to receive free drinks, delicious food, and more, all for free…the main con is that sometimes the surveys take a long time to complete. Surveys can also be quite tedious to do.”
